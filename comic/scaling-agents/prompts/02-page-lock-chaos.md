## Image Prompt

Chalkboard comic page illustration, 4-panel grid layout (2x2), dark blackboard background (#1A1A1A), hand-drawn sketchy chalk lines.

**PAGE LAYOUT**: Four equal panels arranged in 2x2 grid, separated by chalk-drawn panel borders.

---

**PANEL 1 (TOP-LEFT)** - "The Idea":
Multiple eager WORKER robots spawning around a central "SHARED FILE" drawn on a mini-chalkboard within the panel:
- 4-5 WORKER robots with chalk white bodies, orange accents
- Each looking optimistic and eager, arms raised or waving
- Central element: Rectangle representing "SHARED FILE" with file icon
- Chalk yellow sparkles (#FFE566) showing optimism
- Arrows pointing from each worker toward the shared file

Text elements:
- Narrator box at top: "First attempt: Let agents self-coordinate through a shared file"
- Speech bubble from one worker: "We'll share tasks!"

---

**PANEL 2 (TOP-RIGHT)** - "The Lock Appears":
Close-up introduction of THE LOCK character:
- Large anthropomorphized padlock in center, chalk yellow (#FFE566) color
- Smug, grumpy facial expression (eyes as U shapes, frowning line mouth)
- Small crossed arms showing stubbornness
- Powerful, blocking stance
- Chain trailing from the bottom

Small WORKER robots approaching from the sides, looking uncertain/intimidated

Text elements:
- Label with arrow pointing at lock: "THE LOCK"
- Speech bubble from lock: "One at a time!"

---

**PANEL 3 (BOTTOM-LEFT)** - "The Bottleneck":
Overhead/bird's-eye view showing the coordination disaster:
- Central door or gate with THE LOCK blocking it
- Long queue of 6-8 WORKER robots lined up, waiting
- Workers in queue showing frustrated expressions: drooping posture, sweat drops
- Only 1-2 workers actually working on the other side
- Clock symbol showing time passing

Text elements:
- Narrator box: "Twenty agents slowed to the throughput of two or three"
- Multiple small speech bubbles: "Still waiting...", "Let me in!", "Forgot to release!"
- Pink warning accents (#FF9999) appearing on frustrated workers

---

**PANEL 4 (BOTTOM-RIGHT)** - "The Crash":
Dynamic chaotic crash scene:
- THE LOCK broken into 3-4 pieces, debris flying
- WORKER robots tangled in chains from the broken lock
- Some workers crashed with X eyes (indicating failure)
- Spark effects and error symbols flying
- Scattered papers and code blocks everywhere
- Heavy pink/red (#FF9999) warning color accents

Text elements:
- Large sound effect: "CRASH!" in bold dramatic chalk
- Narrator box: "Agents would hold locks too long, forget to release, or fail while holding them"
- Small error symbols (!) scattered

---

**OVERALL STYLE**:
- Clear panel borders in chalk
- Panel numbers subtle in corners (1, 2, 3, 4)
- Consistent chalk texture throughout
- Chalk dust effects especially in crash panel
- Dark chalkboard background visible in panel gutters
- Storytelling flows naturally: idea → obstacle → bottleneck → failure
- Portrait 3:4 aspect ratio
