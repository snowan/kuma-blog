# XHS Content Analysis

**Source**: `source.md`
**Topic**: Using filesystems for agent context engineering
**Type**: Dry Goods / Technical Concept (干货)
**Target Audience**: AI Engineers, Agent Developers

## Core Value
Explains why agents fail at context management (too many tokens, finding niche info) and how a simple filesystem solves this by acting as infinite, searchable memory.

## Visual Flow Strategy
Use the "Problem vs Solution" structure.
1. **Hook**: Why agents fail (Context window overload).
2. **Problems**: 4 key challenges visualized.
3. **Solution**: The Filesystem as "Infinite Memory".
4. **Deep Dive**: How `grep`/`ls` beats semantic search.
5. **Future**: Agents learning by writing to files.

## Style Recommendation
**Style**: `michi` (Make technical concept friendly and approachable)
**Layout**: `balanced` (Mix of diagrams and key points)
