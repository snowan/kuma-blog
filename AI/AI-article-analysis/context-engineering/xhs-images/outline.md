# Infographic Outline

## Image 1: Cover
**Layout**: sparse
**Headlines**: 
- context engineering
- file system
- infinite memory!
**Visual Concept**: Michi the cat holding a magical glowing folder that opens up into an infinite corridor of organized files. 
**Hook**: "Why your Agent needs a Filesystem"

## Image 2: The Problem
**Layout**: comparison
**Headlines**: 
- Context Failures
- Too many tokens
- Hard to find info
**Visual Concept**: Michi looking overwhelmed by a mountain of papers (tokens) vs. Michi happily pulling one specific sheet from a neat cabinet.

## Image 3: The Solution
**Layout**: flow
**Headlines**: 
- Filesystem = Infinite Context
- Store -> Search -> Read
**Visual Concept**: A circular flow diagram where Michi writes to a "Disk", then uses a magnifying glass (grep) to find it, then reads it with a smile.

## Image 4: Semantic vs Filesystem
**Layout**: dense
**Headlines**: 
- Semantic Search vs. Grep
- Fuzzy matching (Hit or Miss)
- Exact lookup (Precise)
**Visual Concept**: 
- Left: Michi confused by a blurry map (Semantic).
- Right: Michi using a coordinate GPS (Grep/LS) to find exact location.

## Image 5: Learning Over Time
**Layout**: lush
**Headlines**: 
- Agents that Learn
