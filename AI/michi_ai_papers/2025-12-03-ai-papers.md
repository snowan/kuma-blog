### I. AI Foundation / Large Models

**1. DeepSeek-V3.2: Pushing the Frontier of Open Large Language Models**
* **Publication Date:** December 2, 2025
* **Problem Solved:** Open-source models typically lag behind proprietary "frontier" models (like GPT-5 or Gemini 3.0) in complex reasoning and long-context efficiency due to compute limitations and inefficient attention mechanisms.
* **Why it Solves the Problem:** DeepSeek-V3.2 introduces **DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA)**, a mechanism that uses a "lightning indexer" to select top-k tokens, drastically reducing long-context compute costs. Combined with a massively scaled post-training Reinforcement Learning framework, it matches proprietary performance without the massive overhead.
* **Key Takeaways:**
    * **DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA)** reduces attention complexity from quadratic to near-linear.
    * **Scalable RL Framework:** Post-training compute budget exceeds 10% of pre-training, unlocking reasoning.
    * **Speciale Variant:** A high-compute version achieves gold-medal performance in IMO 2025.
    * **Agentic Capability:** Generates over 1,800 synthetic environments to train tool-use robustness.
    * **Cost Efficiency:** API pricing dropped by ~50% due to the efficiency of the new architecture.

**2. Mercury: Ultra-Fast Diffusion-based Language Models**
* **Publication Date:** Trending Dec 2, 2025 (arXiv: June 2025)
* **Problem Solved:** Standard LLMs generate text one word at a time (autoregressive), which is inherently slow and creates a latency bottleneck for real-time applications like coding assistants.
* **Why it Solves the Problem:** Mercury uses a **diffusion-based** approach to predict multiple tokens in parallel. Instead of "next token prediction," it refines entire blocks of text simultaneously from noise, achieving roughly 10x faster inference speeds than traditional models.
* **Key Takeaways:**
    * Achieves **1109 tokens/sec** on H100 GPUs (10x faster than comparable models).
    * Performs competitively on coding benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP).

**3. DeepSeekMath-V2: Towards Self-Verifiable Mathematical Reasoning**
* **Publication Date:** November 27, 2025
* **Problem Solved:** LLMs often hallucinate in math because they optimize for the final answer rather than the rigorous logic steps. They lack the ability to "double-check" their work effectively.
* **Why it Solves the Problem:** DeepSeekMath-V2 trains a dedicated **Verifier Model** that critiques the reasoning steps of the main model. This creates a closed feedback loop where the model generates a proof, the verifier checks it, and the model refines it—mimicking human self-correction.
* **Key Takeaways:**
    * Achieves near-perfect score (**118/120**) on Putnam 2024.
    * Reaches Gold Medal performance on IMO 2025.
    * Introduces "Process Supervision" to reward correct *steps*, not just correct *answers*.
    * "Generation-Verification Gap" metric guides continuous self-improvement.
    * Open weights allow researchers to study advanced mathematical reasoning.

**5. Sigmoid-gated SDPA for Stable Scaling (NeurIPS Oral)**
* **Publication Date:** May 2025 (NeurIPS 2025 Best Paper/Oral, Dec 2025)
* **Problem Solved:** Training very large models often fails due to "attention sinks" (over-focusing on the first token) and massive gradient spikes that cause instability.
* **Why it Solves the Problem:** The authors introduce a simple **Sigmoid Gate** after the attention mechanism. This gate acts as a valve, dampening massive spikes and ensuring smooth gradient flow, which allows models to be trained with higher learning rates without crashing.
* **Key Takeaways:**
    * **NeurIPS 2025 Oral Presentation** (Top 1.5% of papers).
    * Simple architectural change eliminates "attention sink" phenomenon.
    * Enables stable training of massive 100B+ parameter models.
    * Improves long-context generalization significantly.
    * Adopted by the Qwen team for their next-generation "Qwen3" architecture.

**7. TUNA: Taming Unified Visual Representations**
* **Publication Date:** December 1, 2025
* **Problem Solved:** Multimodal models usually have separate "brains" for seeing (understanding) and drawing (generation), leading to disjointed performance and inefficient training.
* **Why it Solves the Problem:** TUNA introduces a **Native Unified Multimodal Model** architecture. It connects a VAE encoder (for generation) directly to a representation encoder (for understanding), creating a single continuous visual space that handles both tasks simultaneously.

**9. G²VLM: Geometry Grounded Vision Language Model**
* **Publication Date:** November 26, 2025
* **Problem Solved:** VLMs often "hallucinate" spatial relationships (e.g., misjudging depth) because they process 2D pixels without understanding the 3D world.
* **Why it Solves the Problem:** G²VLM integrates a **3D reconstruction expert** into the vision encoder. It forces the model to predict 3D depth and pose alongside the text, grounding its language generation in physical geometry.
* **Key Takeaways:**
    * Unifies 3D reconstruction with VLM training.
    * Drastically improves spatial reasoning (left/right, depth, occlusion).
    * Outperforms GPT-4o on spatial benchmarks like SPAR-Bench.

### II. AI Agents

**4. Agent0-VL: Self-Evolving Agent via Tool-Integrated Reasoning**
* **Publication Date:** November 25, 2025
* **Problem Solved:** Agents typically hit a performance ceiling because they rely on limited human-labeled training data. They cannot improve autonomously.
* **Why it Solves the Problem:** Agent0-VL uses a **self-evolving loop**. It acts as both student and teacher: it attempts a task, verifies its own answer using code tools (grounded truth), and then updates its policy based on that self-generated feedback, learning entirely from self-play.
* **Key Takeaways:**
    * **Zero Human Data:** Learns entirely through self-play and tool interaction.
    * **Tool-Integrated Verification:** Uses code to mathematically verify its own logic.
    * **Continual Learning:** Performance improves steadily with more iterations.
    * **18-24% Improvement:** Beats baselines on math and reasoning benchmarks.
    * Outperforms existing methods like "Absolute Zero" in efficiency.

**6. MEM1: Synergizing Memory and Reasoning**
* **Publication Date:** Trending Dec 2, 2025 (arXiv: Sept 2025)
* **Problem Solved:** Long-context agents eventually "fill up" their memory, leading to slow performance and confusion ("context bloat").
* **Why it Solves the Problem:** MEM1 treats memory as a learned policy via Reinforcement Learning. It learns to **selectively forget** irrelevant info and compress the rest into a fixed-size internal state, allowing it to run indefinitely without context overflow.
* **Key Takeaways:**
    * Maintains **constant memory size** for infinitely long tasks.
    * Reduces memory usage by 3.7x compared to full-context models.
    * Improves performance by 3.5x on multi-objective tasks.

**10. Automated Hierarchy Restructuring with LLMs**
* **Publication Date:** November 22, 2025
* **Problem Solved:** Integrating LLMs into hierarchical planning is hard because human-defined task hierarchies are often messy or unoptimized for AI.
* **Why it Solves the Problem:** Proposes using LLMs as "Knowledge Engineers." The model analyzes the task hierarchy, autonomously restructures it (e.g., decomposing complex nodes), and optimizes the data structure *before* the planning agent attempts to solve it.
