### I. AI Foundation / Large Models

**1. Mercury: Ultra-Fast Diffusion-based Language Models**
* **Publication Date:** June 17, 2025 (Trending Dec 1)
* **Problem Solved:** Traditional Autoregressive (AR) LLMs generate text sequentially (one word at a time), which creates a bottleneck for speed and high inference costs in real-time applications.
* **Why it Solves the Problem:** Mercury replaces sequential generation with a **diffusion-based** framework. It generates entire blocks of text in parallel through a coarse-to-fine refinement process, maintaining quality while drastically increasing speed.
* **Key Takeaways:**
    * Achieves >1000 tokens/second on H100 GPUs (up to 10x faster than standard LLMs).
    * Uses a novel "block-level" diffusion mechanism for parallel sampling.
    * Maintains competitive performance on coding benchmarks (comparable to proprietary models).
    * Fully compatible with existing Transformer infrastructure (easy to deploy).
    * Significantly reduces the cost-per-token for large-scale serving.

**3. G²VLM: Geometry Grounded Vision Language Model**
* **Publication Date:** November 27, 2025
* **Problem Solved:** Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often hallucinate spatial relationships (e.g., misidentifying "left" vs "right" or depth) because they lack true 3D geometric understanding of 2D images.
* **Why it Solves the Problem:** Introduces a specialized 3D reconstruction module directly into the VLM training pipeline. This forces the model to learn "geometry-grounded" tokens, ensuring its language descriptions match the physical 3D reality of the scene.
* **Key Takeaways:**
    * Unifies 3D reconstruction tasks with standard VLM training.
    * Drastically improves performance on spatial reasoning and object manipulation tasks.
    * Reduces "spatial hallucinations" in generated descriptions.
    * Enables more accurate control for robotics applications.
    * Open source code is driving significant community interest.

**4. AssurAI: Korean Multimodal Safety Evaluation**
* **Publication Date:** November 26, 2025
* **Problem Solved:** Most AI safety benchmarks are English-centric and miss culturally specific risks (e.g., local taboos, historical sensitivities) in non-Western contexts like Korea.
* **Why it Solves the Problem:** Creates a dedicated, expert-curated benchmark (AssurAI) with 35 distinct risk factors tailored to Korean culture, evaluating both text and image generation for localized safety compliance.
* **Key Takeaways:**
    * First comprehensive multimodal safety benchmark for the Korean cultural context.
    * Identifies 35 specific risk categories (universal + culture-specific).
    * Reveals that "safe" Western models often fail in local contexts.
    * Essential for the global deployment of "aligned" foundation models.
    * Proposes a new standard for decentralized, region-specific AI auditing.

**6. Sigmoid-gated SDPA for Stable Scaling**
* **Publication Date:** November 28, 2025
* **Problem Solved:** Training massive models is unstable due to gradient spikes in the attention mechanism (specifically Scaled Dot-Product Attention), leading to crashes or poor convergence.
* **Why it Solves the Problem:** Integrates a simple **sigmoid gate** into the attention block. This acts as a "damper," stabilizing gradient flow and preventing values from exploding, which allows for smoother training of extremely large models.
* **Key Takeaways:**
    * NeurIPS 2025 Best Paper Award winner.
    * Simple architectural change with massive stability benefits.
    * Prevents "loss spikes" during the pre-training of giant models.
    * Improves convergence speed and reliability.
    * Likely to become a standard component in future Transformer architectures.

**8. On the Limits of Innate Planning in LLMs**
* **Publication Date:** November 27, 2025
* **Problem Solved:** There is a debate about whether LLMs can truly "plan" (think ahead) or if they just memorize complex solution patterns.
* **Why it Solves the Problem:** Tests models on adversarial planning tasks where memorized patterns don't work. The results prove that without external search tools (like Monte Carlo Tree Search), LLMs fail at novel planning, distinguishing "approximate retrieval" from "true planning."
* **Key Takeaways:**
    * Proves LLMs struggle with planning outside of their training distribution.
    * Distinguishes between "pattern matching" and "symbolic search."
    * Suggests that "System 2" reasoning (slow thinking) requires external architecture.
    * Sets realistic bounds on what standalone LLMs can achieve autonomously.
    * validates the need for neuro-symbolic approaches.

**9. Reasoning Language Models: A Blueprint**
* **Publication Date:** November 24, 2025
* **Problem Solved:** Proprietary "reasoning" models (like o1) are black boxes. The open-source community lacks a clear recipe for building models that can verify their own logic step-by-step.
* **Why it Solves the Problem:** Provides a complete "blueprint" for training Reasoning Language Models (RLMs), including architectural modules for memory, verification, and search, effectively democratizing "Chain of Thought" training.
* **Key Takeaways:**
    * Open-source framework for training "System 2" reasoners.
    * Details modular components for memory and logic verification.
    * Shifts focus from "answer accuracy" to "process correctness."
    * Includes datasets and protocols for high-fidelity reasoning training.
    * Critical resource for replicating proprietary reasoning capabilities.

**10. Breakthroughs in AI Forgetting Mechanisms**
* **Publication Date:** November 25, 2025
* **Problem Solved:** Once a model learns sensitive or copyrighted data, it is nearly impossible to "delete" that specific data without re-training the whole model from scratch.
* **Why it Solves the Problem:** Introduces "nested learning" protocols that allow specific data subsets to be mathematically "unlearned" (erased) efficiently, providing guarantees that the data cannot be recovered.
* **Key Takeaways:**
    * Mathematical guarantee of data erasure (privacy compliance).
    * Avoids the massive cost of full model retraining.
    * Preserves the model's general performance after unlearning.
    * Key enabler for GDPR/CCPA compliance in enterprise AI.
    * derived from joint research on efficient memory management.

### II. AI Agents

**2. $A^2Flow$: Automating Agentic Workflow Generation**
* **Publication Date:** November 23, 2025
* **Problem Solved:** Designing workflows for AI agents is manual and brittle. Agents often get stuck because they follow rigid human-written rules that don't fit every situation.
* **Why it Solves the Problem:** $A^2Flow$ allows the agent to **write its own workflow**. It looks at demonstrations and automatically extracts "Self-Adaptive Abstraction Operators," creating a flexible, custom flowchart for the task at hand.
* **Key Takeaways:**
    * Eliminates manual, brittle workflow engineering.
    * Agents autonomously optimize their own process granularity.
    * Achieves ~19% performance improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.
    * Reduces token usage and cost by up to 37%.
    * Enables smaller models to perform like larger ones by working smarter.

**5. MEM1: Consolidating Memory in RL Agents**
* **Publication Date:** November 25, 2025
* **Problem Solved:** Long-context agents eventually "fill up" their context window or get confused by too much history, making them bad at long-term tasks.
* **Why it Solves the Problem:** MEM1 uses Reinforcement Learning to train a "memory policy." The agent learns to compress its history into a compact "state vector"—keeping only what matters and discarding noise—allowing it to remember effectively forever.
* **Key Takeaways:**
    * Trains agents to *selectively* forget and remember.
    * Solves the "context overflow" problem for long-horizon tasks.
    * Outperforms RAG-based methods on procedural memory tasks.
    * Produces interpretable memory traces (we can see what it chose to keep).
    * Reduces inference latency by removing the need to read huge logs.

**7. Agentic Learner with Grow-and-Refine Memory**
* **Publication Date:** November 27, 2025
* **Problem Solved:** Agents usually have static memory (like a file folder). They can't "learn" new concepts or relationships from their experiences in a structured way.
* **Why it Solves the Problem:** Uses a "Grow-and-Refine" mechanism. As the agent sees new things (text, images), it dynamically expands its internal knowledge graph (Grow) and then consolidates overlapping ideas (Refine), effectively "learning" like a human does.
* **Key Takeaways:**
    * Multimodal memory that learns from text and vision simultaneously.
    * Dynamic structure that evolves as the agent gathers experience.
    * Adapts faster to new environments than static-memory agents.
    * Enables continuous, lifelong learning for autonomous systems.
    * successfully tested on complex embodied navigation tasks.
