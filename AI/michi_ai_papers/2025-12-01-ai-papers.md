### I. AI Foundation / Large Models

**1. Mercury: Ultra-Fast Diffusion-based Language Models**
* **Publication Date:** Trending Dec 2, 2025 (Original ArXiv: June 2025)
* **Problem Solved:** Traditional Autoregressive (AR) LLMs generate text sequentially (one token at a time), which creates a fundamental speed bottleneck and high inference latency.
* **Why it Solves the Problem:** Mercury introduces a **diffusion-based** generation mechanism that predicts multiple tokens in parallel. It uses a coarse-to-fine refinement process within a Transformer architecture, allowing it to generate entire blocks of code or text simultaneously rather than waiting for the previous word.
* **Key Takeaways:**
    * Achieves **1109 tokens/sec** throughput on H100 GPUs (approx. 10x faster than standard models).
    * Performs competitively on coding benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP) against proprietary models.
    * Retains the standard Transformer architecture, ensuring compatibility with existing optimization tools.
    * Represents a shift from "next-token prediction" to "parallel sequence diffusion."
    * Validated on Copilot Arena, ranking highly for speed and quality trade-off.

**3. DeepSeekMath-V2: Towards Self-Verifiable Mathematical Reasoning**
* **Publication Date:** November 27, 2025
* **Problem Solved:** Models often get the right answer for the wrong reasons, or fail at rigorous step-by-step derivation in math problems because they lack a way to "check their work" reliably.
* **Why it Solves the Problem:** DeepSeekMath-V2 trains a strong **verifier** model that acts as a reward signal for the reasoning generator. It creates a closed loop where the model generates a proof, the verifier critiques it, and the model refines it—incentivizing the system to find and fix its own errors before finalizing an answer.
* **Key Takeaways:**
    * Achieves near-perfect score (**118/120**) on the Putnam 2024 competition.
    * Reaches Gold Medal level performance on IMO 2025 and CMO 2024.
    * Introduces a "generation-verification gap" metric to drive self-improvement.
    * Demonstrates that "process supervision" (checking steps) is superior to "outcome supervision" (checking answers).
    * Open weights release is driving significant community interest.

**6. TUNA: Taming Unified Visual Representations for Native Unified Multimodal Models**
* **Publication Date:** December 1, 2025
* **Problem Solved:** Most multimodal models use separate encoders for "understanding" (seeing images) and "generation" (drawing images), leading to disjointed representations and inefficient training.
* **Why it Solves the Problem:** TUNA introduces a **Native Unified Multimodal Model** (UMM) architecture. It connects a VAE encoder directly to a representation encoder to create a single, continuous visual space that works for both understanding inputs and generating outputs, eliminating the need for separate "vision" and "generation" brains.
* **Key Takeaways:**
    * Unifies image understanding and generation in a single framework.
    * Cascades VAE encoder with representation encoder for continuous features.
    * Outperforms decoupled models on both understanding and generation benchmarks.
    * Simplifies the architecture by removing representation format mismatches.
    * Enables complex tasks like image editing within the same unified model.

**7. G²VLM: Geometry Grounded Vision Language Model**
* **Publication Date:** November 26, 2025
* **Problem Solved:** Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often "hallucinate" spatial details (e.g., misjudging depth or position) because they process 2D pixels without understanding the underlying 3D structure.
* **Why it Solves the Problem:** G²VLM integrates a dedicated **3D reconstruction expert** into the VLM. It is trained to predict 3D attributes (depth, pose) directly from 2D images, forcing the language model to ground its reasoning in the physical geometry of the scene rather than just pixel patterns.
* **Key Takeaways:**
    * First unified model for 3D reconstruction and spatial understanding.
    * Uses separate "Semantic" and "Geometric" perception experts.
    * Outperforms GPT-4o on spatial reasoning benchmarks (SPAR-Bench).
    * Eliminates reliance on hard-to-collect 3D annotated data by learning from 2D.
    * Bridges the gap between "seeing" (pixels) and "understanding" (space).

**8. Sigmoid-gated SDPA for Stable Scaling**
* **Publication Date:** November 28, 2025
* **Problem Solved:** Training very large models is unstable; gradient spikes in the attention mechanism often cause training runs to crash or diverge.
* **Why it Solves the Problem:** The authors (Qwen team) introduce a simple **sigmoid gate** after the Scaled Dot-Product Attention (SDPA) block. This gate acts as a learnable "valve" that dampens massive activation spikes, ensuring smoother gradient flow and allowing for higher learning rates without instability.
* **Key Takeaways:**
    * NeurIPS 2025 research highlight.
    * Simple architectural change yields massive stability gains.
    * Mitigates "attention sink" problems where models over-attend to the first token.
    * Enables stable training of massive MoE (Mixture of Experts) models.
    * Likely to become a standard component in next-gen LLM architectures.

**9. AssurAI: Korean Multimodal Safety Dataset**
* **Publication Date:** November 20, 2025
* **Problem Solved:** AI safety benchmarks are English-centric and miss culturally specific risks (e.g., regional taboos, historical sensitivities) in non-Western contexts.
* **Why it Solves the Problem:** Creates **AssurAI**, a quality-controlled benchmark with 35 distinct risk factors tailored specifically to Korean culture. It evaluates multimodal (text+image) outputs to detect "cultural hallucinations" or offensive content that Western safety filters might miss.
* **Key Takeaways:**
    * First large-scale Korean multimodal safety benchmark (11,480 instances).
    * Defines a taxonomy of 35 culture-specific AI risk factors.
    * Reveals that "globally safe" models fail significantly in local contexts.
    * Uses a triple-check annotation process for high data quality.
    * Critical for the safe deployment of GenAI in Asian markets.

**10. Automated Hierarchy Restructuring with LLMs**
* **Publication Date:** November 22, 2025
* **Problem Solved:** Integrating LLMs into Hierarchical Planning (HP) is difficult because human-defined hierarchies are often messy or unoptimized for AI reasoning.
* **Why it Solves the Problem:** Proposes a roadmap and taxonomy for using LLMs as "Knowledge Engineers" to automatically restructure and optimize planning hierarchies. It leverages the LLM's semantic understanding to clean up the data structure *before* the planning agent tries to use it.
* **Key Takeaways:**
    * Establishes a taxonomy for LLM integration in Hierarchical Planning.
    * Demonstrates LLMs can act as "translators" to refine problem definitions.
    * Proposes strategies like "Decomposition" and "Revision" for plan improvement.
    * Bridges the gap between Automated Planning (AP) and Generative AI.
    * Offers a benchmark for evaluating LLMs in structured planning tasks.

### II. AI Agents

**2. Agent0-VL: Self-Evolving Agent via Tool-Integrated Reasoning**
* **Publication Date:** November 25, 2025
* **Problem Solved:** Agents typically hit a performance ceiling because they rely on limited human-labeled training data. They can't "get smarter" on their own.
* **Why it Solves the Problem:** Agent0-VL uses a **self-evolving loop**. It acts as both the "student" (Solver) and the "teacher" (Verifier). It attempts tasks using tools (like code interpreters), evaluates its own success based on the tool output (grounded truth), and updates itself using Reinforcement Learning—all without human data.
* **Key Takeaways:**
    * **Zero Human Data:** Learns entirely through self-play and tool interaction.
    * **Tool-Integrated Verification:** Uses code execution to verify its own answers.
    * **Continual Learning:** Performance improves steadily with more self-play iterations.
    * **18-24% Improvement:** Beats baselines on math and general reasoning benchmarks.
    * Outperforms existing self-play methods like "Absolute Zero."

* **Source:** [arXiv:2511.19900](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19900)

**4. MEM1: Synergizing Memory and Reasoning for Efficient Long-Horizon Agents**
* **Publication Date:** Trending Dec 2, 2025 (Original ArXiv: Sept/Oct 2025)
* **Problem Solved:** Long-context agents eventually "fill up" their memory or get confused by irrelevant history ("context bloat"), causing them to fail on long tasks.
* **Why it Solves the Problem:** MEM1 treats memory as a learned policy. Instead of saving everything, it uses Reinforcement Learning to update a **compact, fixed-size internal state**. It learns to "compress" necessary info and "forget" the rest, maintaining constant memory usage regardless of task length.
* **Key Takeaways:**
    * Maintains **constant memory size** for infinitely long tasks.
    * Reduces memory usage by 3.7x compared to full-context models.
    * Improves performance by 3.5x on multi-objective tasks.
    * Learns interpretable "forgetting" strategies (e.g., discarding completed sub-goals).
    * Eliminates the need for external vector databases for many tasks.
