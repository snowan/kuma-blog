### I. AI Agents

**1. Agent0-VL: Exploring Self-Evolving Agent for Tool-Integrated Vision-Language Reasoning**
* **Publication Date:** November 24, 2025
* **Problem Solved:** Existing vision-language agents struggle with continual improvement because they rely on static training data or human-curated examples, which limits their ability to adapt to new tools and complex visual tasks.
* **Why it Solves it:** Agent0-VL introduces a self-evolving framework. It generates its own training data by attempting tasks, using tools, and then critically evaluating its own performance (self-evaluation) to learn from successes and failures, creating a loop of autonomous improvement without human intervention.
* **Key Takeaways:**
    * First self-evolving Vision-Language Model (VLM) agent framework.
    * Incorporates tool usage directly into the reasoning and self-evaluation loop.
    * Eliminates the need for expensive human-annotated tool-use datasets.
    * Demonstrates continual improvement on unseen visual tasks through self-play.
    * Outperforms supervised baselines by learning from its own evidence-grounded analysis.

**2. GAM: General Agentic Memory via Deep Research**
* **Publication Date:** November 23, 2025
* **Problem Solved:** Long-horizon agentic tasks often fail because agents "forget" critical context or get overwhelmed by irrelevant information in their context window (memory overflow).
* **Why it Solves it:** GAM mimics a computer's memory hierarchy. It uses a "lightweight memorizer" to quickly store/retrieve immediate context and a "researcher" module that digs deeper when needed. It treats memory management as a Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation process, optimizing what stays in "RAM" vs. "Disk."
* **Key Takeaways:**
    * Implements a JIT-compilation inspired memory system for agents.
    * Decouples "Memorizer" (fast access) from "Researcher" (deep retrieval).
    * Significantly improves efficiency on long-context tasks.
    * Reduces memory overhead while maintaining high task completion rates.
    * Enables agents to handle multi-day or multi-step workflows without losing state.

**3. LatentMAS: Latent Collaboration in Multi-Agent Systems**
* **Publication Date:** November 25, 2025
* **Problem Solved:** When multiple AI agents collaborate, they typically talk to each other in English (natural language). This is slow, expensive (lots of tokens), and imprecise for machine-to-machine coordination.
* **Why it Solves it:** LatentMAS allows agents to communicate by exchanging "latent states" (dense vector representations of thoughts) instead of decoding them into text. This is like telepathy for AI—faster, cheaper, and retaining more semantic nuance than text.
* **Key Takeaways:**
    * Replaces natural language dialogue with efficient latent space vectors.
    * Drastically reduces computational cost and latency for multi-agent teams.
    * Improves reasoning quality by avoiding the information loss of text decoding.
    * Agents learn to interpret each other's "brain waves" (vectors) directly.
    * Achieves higher success rates on cooperative benchmarks like math or coding.

**4. GigaWorld-0: World Models as Data Engine to Empower Embodied AI**
* **Publication Date:** November 24, 2025
* **Problem Solved:** Robots and embodied agents need massive amounts of real-world training data (e.g., video of a robot opening a door), which is slow and expensive to collect physically.
* **Why it Solves it:** GigaWorld-0 is a "World Model" that generates highly realistic, physically plausible videos of robots interacting with the world. It serves as an infinite "Data Engine," creating synthetic training data that is so good agents can learn from it and transfer those skills to the real world.
* **Key Takeaways:**
    * Unified framework integrating video generation and 3D modeling.
    * Produces diverse, physically plausible video data for robot training.
    * Enables "Sim-to-Real" transfer without needing real-world training data.
    * Solves the "data scarcity" problem for Embodied AI.
    * Demonstrates strong performance on manipulation tasks using only synthetic data.

**5. Collaborative Reasoner (Coral): Self-improving Social Agents**
* **Publication Date:** Trending Nov 2025 (Meta AI)
* **Problem Solved:** AI agents are often bad at *social* collaboration—they struggle to disagree constructively, negotiate, or convince other agents of a correct solution in a group setting.
* **Why it Solves it:** Coral is a framework that specifically trains agents on "collaborative reasoning" skills. It uses a synthetic data engine (Matrix) to simulate millions of social interactions where agents must debate and agree, filtering for successful "social" outcomes to train the model.
* **Key Takeaways:**
    * Focuses on "social IQ" skills: negotiation, persuasion, and consensus.
    * Uses "Matrix," a scalable multi-agent communication sandbox.
    * Trains agents to disagree to incorrect solutions rather than blindly following.
    * Shows that current LLMs fail at collaboration without specific training.
    * Self-improvement loop creates agents that are better teammates.

### II. AI Foundation / Large Models

**6. Mercury: Ultra-Fast Diffusion-based Language Models**
* **Publication Date:** Trending Nov 2025 (Viral on Reddit)
* **Problem Solved:** Traditional LLMs (like GPT-4) generate text one word at a time (autoregressive), which is slow.
* **Why it Solves it:** Mercury uses a **diffusion** process (like image generators) to generate entire blocks of text in parallel. It starts with noisy text and "denoises" it into a coherent sentence all at once, achieving speeds up to 10x faster than standard models.
* **Key Takeaways:**
    * Generates multiple tokens in parallel via coarse-to-fine refinement.
    * Achieves 10x higher throughput than autoregressive models.
    * "Mercury Coder" model performs competitively on coding benchmarks.
    * Retains compatibility with Transformer infrastructure.
    * Represents a paradigm shift from "next-token prediction" to "sequence diffusion."

**7. SAM 3: Segment Anything with Concepts**
* **Publication Date:** November 20, 2025 (Meta AI)
* **Problem Solved:** Previous segmentation models (SAM 1 & 2) could "cut out" objects but didn't inherently understand *what* they were (semantics/concepts) at a deep level.
* **Why it Solves it:** SAM 3 unifies segmentation (cutting out pixels) with concept recognition (understanding the object). It decouples recognition from localization, allowing it to segment objects based on complex text prompts and high-level concepts, not just clicks or boxes.
* **Key Takeaways:**
    * State-of-the-art in "promptable concept segmentation."
    * Unified architecture for both recognition (what) and localization (where).
    * Can track and segment concepts across video frames.
    * Massive improvement in handling abstract or specific concept queries.
    * Open-sourced by Meta, driving immediate community adoption.

**8. HunyuanOCR: Lightweight Vision-Language Model for OCR**
* **Publication Date:** November 24, 2025 (Tencent)
* **Problem Solved:** Extracting text from complex images (OCR) usually requires heavy, specialized models or separate detection/recognition steps that fail on messy documents.
* **Why it Solves it:** HunyuanOCR uses a unified, end-to-end Vision-Language Model (VLM) architecture. It combines a Vision Transformer (to see) with a lightweight LLM (to read), allowing it to transcribe text directly from pixels with "state-of-the-art" accuracy while being small enough to run efficiently.
* **Key Takeaways:**
    * Unified end-to-end architecture (no separate detection step).
    * Combines Vision Transformer with a lightweight LLM.

* **Why it Solves it:** Introduces **AssurAI**, a culturally specific safety benchmark. It defines 35 distinct risk factors relevant to Korean culture and evaluates multimodal (image+text) models, exposing gaps that global benchmarks miss.
* **Key Takeaways:**
    * Addresses the "non-English safety gap" in Foundation Models.
    * Defines 35 distinct AI risk factors, including cultural nuances.
    * Evaluates safety in a Multimodal context (Image + Text).
    * Crucial for the global deployment of "Safe" AI systems.
    * Reveals that "aligned" Western models can still fail in other cultures.

**10. Automated Hierarchy Restructuring with LLMs**
* **Publication Date:** November 26, 2025
* **Problem Solved:** Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are essential for RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), but human-made hierarchies are often messy, imbalanced, or structurally poor for AI to process.
* **Why it Solves it:** Proposes using LLMs themselves as "Knowledge Engineers." The paper demonstrates that LLMs can automatically analyze a messy hierarchy and "refactor" it—optimizing branching factors and inheritance structures—to make it perfect for hyperbolic embeddings and efficient retrieval.
* **Key Takeaways:**
    * LLMs can autonomously "clean up" human knowledge structures.
    * Optimizes hierarchies for mathematical embedding efficiency.
    * Robust to imbalance in the original data.
