## Top 10 Trending AI Papers

Here are the most discussed AI papers from the last 24-48 hours, categorized by their primary contribution.

### I. AI Agents

**1. Kosmos: An AI Scientist for Autonomous Discovery**
* **Publication Date:** Nov 04, 2025 (Revised Nov 2025)
* **Problem Solved:** Existing "AI Scientist" agents lose coherence after a few steps and cannot conduct deep, long-horizon research (e.g., executing code, reading literature, and hypothesizing simultaneously).

* **Key Takeaways:**
    1. Automates the entire scientific discovery loop (data -> hypothesis -> report).
    2. Read 1,500 papers and wrote 42,000 lines of code in a single run.
    3. Independent scientists verified 79.4% of its statements as accurate.
    4. Made 7 novel discoveries in materials science and metabolomics.
    5. Demonstrates "linear scaling" of scientific output with agent cycles.

**3. How Do AI Agents Do Human Work?**
* **Publication Date:** Nov 06, 2025 (Revised)

* **Why it Solves it:** Uses a new toolkit to induce "structured workflows" from agent activity. It compares human vs. agent execution traces across design, data analysis, and coding.
* **Key Takeaways:**
    1. Agents are 88.3% faster and ~95% cheaper than humans.
    2. Agents take an "overwhelmingly programmatic" approach, even for visual design tasks.
    3. Humans rely on intuition; agents rely on code execution loops.
    4. Identifies specific "human-agent alignment" gaps in open-ended tasks.
    5. Suggests a future of "delegating programmable sub-tasks" rather than full job replacement.

**4. Browser-Use: Browser Automation Benchmark**
* **Publication Date:** Trending Nov 28, 2025 (Reddit/GitHub)
* **Problem Solved:** Existing browser agents are brittle, slow, and expensive to run, often failing on complex modern websites.
* **Why it Solves it:** A new library/benchmark "Browser-Use" that wraps agents in a high-performance environment, achieving 100% success on tasks where previous agents had 30%.
* **Key Takeaways:**
    1. Achieved 100% success rate on benchmark tasks (vs 30% baseline).
    2. Reduced token costs by 65% by optimizing the context sent to the agent.
    3. 82% fewer steps required to complete tasks.
    4. Viral GitHub repository trending on Reddit r/MachineLearning.
    5. Allows wrapping any LangChain agent in ~10 lines of code.
