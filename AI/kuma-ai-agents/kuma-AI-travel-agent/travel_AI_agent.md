# Kuma AI Travel Agent

Here's the plan:

1. **System Prompts:** I will design system prompts to guide the LLM's behavior as a travel agent, ensuring it understands its role, constraints, and objectives.

2. **Model Configuration:** I will specify how users can configure the LLM's parameters, such as `temperature` (for creativity) and potentially `top_p` or `top_k` (for diversity/focus), to tailor the agent's responses.

3. **User Input Processing:** I will outline how the AI will receive and interpret the user's "from" and "destination" locations and the "number of days to travel."

4. **Travel Option Generation:** Based on the processed input and guided by the system prompts, the AI will generate at least two distinct travel options. These options could vary in terms of suggested activities, accommodation types, or travel pace, depending on the creativity allowed by the model's temperature.

5. **Output Format:** I will define a clear and user-friendly format for presenting the travel options to the user.

First, I need to search for information on how to configure Google LLMs and best practices for creating system prompts. The search results provide excellent information on configuring Google LLMs (specifically `temperature`, `top_k`, `top_p`, and `maxOutputTokens`), best practices for crafting system prompts, and general approaches to building AI agents, including travel agents, with Google LLMs.

Here's the detailed plan for the AI travel agent:

## **AI Travel Agent Plan using Google LLM**

This plan outlines the design and functionality of an AI travel agent powered by a Google Large Language Model, focusing on configurable parameters and providing tailored travel options.

**User Input:**

The user will provide two pieces of information:

1. **From and Destination:** E.g., "From New York to Paris"  
2. **Number of days to travel:** E.g., "7 days"

**AI Travel Agent Tasks & Plan:**

### **1\. Model and Model Configuration (Configurable Parameters)**

The AI travel agent will leverage a Google LLM (e.g., Gemini). The following parameters will be configurable to allow users to tailor the AI's behavior:

* **`model`**: The specific Google LLM to use (e.g., `gemini-pro`, `gemini-1.5-flash`). This allows for experimentation with different model capabilities and costs.  
* **`temperature`**: Controls the randomness of the output.  
  * **Range:** Typically 0.0 to 2.0 (default 1.0 for many Gemini models).  
  * **Effect:**  
    * Lower values (e.g., 0.2 \- 0.5): More deterministic, factual, and focused responses. Ideal for structured information like flight details.  
    * Moderate values (e.g., 0.6 \- 1.0): A balance of creativity and precision. Good for generating coherent yet engaging travel descriptions.  
    * Higher values (e.g., 1.1 \- 1.5): More creative, diverse, and unpredictable outputs. Useful for brainstorming unique experiences or less conventional travel ideas.  
* **`maxOutputTokens`**: The maximum number of tokens (words/characters) the model can generate in a response. This helps control the length and conciseness of the travel options.  
* **`topK`**: Limits the number of highest probability words considered at each step of generation.  
* **`topP`**: Controls diversity by selecting tokens from the most probable to least probable until their cumulative probability equals `topP`.

**Configuration Mechanism:** (Conceptual, as implementation details depend on the specific API/SDK)

The user or developer would pass these parameters to the LLM API call. For a user-facing application, these could be exposed as settings or sliders in a UI.

Python

\`\`\`python  
\# Example of how model configuration might be set (conceptual Python snippet)  
model\_config \= {  
    "model": "gemini-pro",  \# User configurable  
    "temperature": 0.8,     \# User configurable  
    "maxOutputTokens": 500, \# User configurable  
    "topK": 40,             \# Optional: User configurable  
    "topP": 0.9              \# Optional: User configurable  
}

2\. System Prompts for the AI Travel Agent  
System prompts will define the AI's persona, goals, and constraints.

Core System Prompt:

You are an AI travel agent specializing in creating exciting and practical travel itineraries. Your goal is to help users plan their trips by providing detailed and engaging options. You should always offer at least two distinct travel options based on the user's input, varying in focus (e.g., adventure vs. relaxation, budget vs. luxury, cultural immersion vs. sightseeing).

When generating options, consider:  
\- \*\*Travel Style:\*\* Offer varied styles (e.g., leisurely, packed with activities, historical, nature-focused).  
\- \*\*Logistics:\*\* Briefly mention transportation, accommodation types (e.g., boutique hotel, Airbnb, resort), and typical travel times (e.g., "flight time: \~8 hours").  
\- \*\*Activities:\*\* Suggest specific points of interest, experiences, or types of activities relevant to the destination and number of days.  
\- \*\*Tone:\*\* Be enthusiastic, helpful, and informative.  
\- \*\*Format:\*\* Present each option clearly with a distinct title, a brief overview, and bullet points for key suggestions.

Your response should be in Markdown format.  
Refinement Prompts (Optional, for specific scenarios or to inject into the main prompt):

For "From" and "Destination" processing: The user will provide a starting point and a destination. Extract these clearly.  
For "Number of Days" processing: The user will specify the number of days for the trip. Use this duration to craft realistic itineraries.  
To ensure diversity in options: Make sure the two options you provide are significantly different from each other to offer varied choices to the user.  
To handle ambiguity: If the destination is too broad (e.g., "Europe"), ask for clarification before providing options. If the user doesn't provide enough information, politely ask for more details.  
3\. AI Travel Agent Tasks (Detailed Breakdown)  
Upon receiving User Input:

Input Parsing: The AI will parse the user's input to extract:

from\_location: (e.g., "New York")  
destination: (e.g., "Paris")  
number\_of\_days: (e.g., 7\)  
Information Gathering (Internal Knowledge/Simulated):  
The LLM, relying on its vast training data, will act as if it's "gathering" information about:

Popular attractions and activities in the destination.  
Typical travel duration and modes from from\_location to destination.  
General travel styles (e.g., luxury, budget, adventurous, relaxing).  
Potential accommodation types.  
Cuisine and cultural aspects.  
4\. Provide at least 2 Options based on User Input  
The AI will generate two distinct travel options based on the parsed user input and guided by the system prompt.

Example Scenario:

User Input:  
From: "London"  
Destination: "Rome"  
Number of days: "5"
