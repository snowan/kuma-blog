Cinematic narrative style with full-bleed visuals and emotional impact

## Design Aesthetic

Cinematic, full-bleed imagery that creates emotional connection. Story-driven compositions that guide the viewer through a narrative arc. Each slide is a scene in a larger story. Photography and illustration work together to create atmosphere.

## Background

- Color: Varies by mood - dark for drama (#0F0F0F), warm for comfort (#FDF8F3)
- Texture: Photographic or illustrated backgrounds, subtle vignetting

## Typography

### Primary Font (Headlines)

Elegant serif like Playfair Display, Libre Baskerville, or editorial serif. Large, expressive headlines that complement imagery. Can use italic for emotional emphasis.

### Secondary Font (Body)

Clean sans-serif for contrast and readability. Light weight to not compete with imagery. White or dark depending on background.
