# bold-editorial

High-impact magazine editorial style with bold visual expression

## Design Aesthetic

Strong visual impact at magazine cover level. Bold typography and dramatic contrast. Full-bleed imagery and large color blocks create commanding presence. Every slide feels like a premium publication cover.

## Background

- Color: Deep Black (#0A0A0A) primary, or Deep Blue (#0F172A) alternative
- Texture: None - clean solid backgrounds, or pure white with bold color blocks

## Typography

### Primary Font (Headlines)

Bold condensed typeface like Impact, Oswald Bold, or Bebas Neue. Oversized headlines that dominate the slide. All-caps for maximum impact. Tight letter-spacing.

### Secondary Font (Body)

Clean sans-serif such as Inter, SF Pro, or Helvetica Neue. Medium weight for body text. High contrast against background.
