# sketch-notes

Soft hand-drawn illustration style with fresh, refined minimalist editorial aesthetic

## Design Aesthetic

Illustration or hand-drawn feel with soft, relaxed brush strokes. Fresh, refined overall style with minimalist editorial approach. Emphasis on precision, clarity and intelligent elegance while prioritizing warmth, approachability and friendliness.

## Background

- Color: Warm Off-White (#FAF8F0)
- Texture: Subtle paper grain, slightly warm tone to avoid clinical feel

## Typography

### Primary Font (Headlines)

Bold hand-written marker font or cartoon poster font. Slightly uneven baseline for organic feel. Thick strokes with soft edges. Render as hand-drawn letters, not typed text.

### Secondary Font (Body)

Clear handwritten round or hard-pen style mimicking everyday notes. Consistent sizing with slight natural variation. Render as casual handwriting, legible but not mechanical.

## Visual Elements

- Conceptual abstract icons illustrating ideas rather than literal scenes
- Color fills don't need to completely fill outlines - preserve hand-painted casual feel
- Simple geometric shapes with rounded corners
- Arrows and pointers with sketchy, informal style
- Doodle-style decorative elements: stars, spirals, underlines

## Style Rules

### Do

- Keep layouts open and well-structured
- Emphasize information hierarchy and readability
- Use hand-drawn quality for all elements
- Allow imperfection - slight wobbles add character
- Layer elements with subtle overlaps

### Don't

- Use perfect geometric shapes
- Create photorealistic elements
- Overcrowd with too many elements
- Use pure white backgrounds
- Add slide numbers, footers, or logos
