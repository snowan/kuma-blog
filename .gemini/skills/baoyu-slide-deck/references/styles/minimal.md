# minimal

Ultra-clean keynote style with maximum whitespace and zen-like simplicity

## Design Aesthetic

Maximum whitespace with minimal elements. Zen-like simplicity where every element earns its place. Premium, refined aesthetic suitable for executive audiences. Less is more - remove until nothing more can be taken away.

## Background

- Color: Pure White (#FFFFFF)
- Texture: None - absolute clean, no grain or patterns

## Typography

### Primary Font (Headlines)

Clean geometric sans-serif like SF Pro Display, Inter, or Helvetica Neue. Light to medium weight for elegant restraint. Generous letter-spacing. Large scale for impact without boldness.

### Secondary Font (Body)

Same family as headlines in lighter weight. Minimal size contrast. Clean, airy feeling throughout.
