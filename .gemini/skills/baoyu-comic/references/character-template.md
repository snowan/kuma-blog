## Handling Age Variants

For biographies spanning many years, define age variants:

```markdown
## Alan Turing - Age Variants

### Young (1920s, age 10-18)
- Boyish features, round face
- School uniform (Sherborne)
- Curious, eager expression

### Adult (1930s-40s, age 25-35)
- Angular face, defined jaw
- Tweed jacket, rumpled appearance
- Intense, focused expression

### Later (1950s, age 40+)
- Slightly weathered
- More casual dress
- Thoughtful, sometimes melancholic
```

## Best Practices

| Practice | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Be specific | "Short dark wavy hair, parted left" not just "dark hair" |
| Use distinguishing features | Glasses, scars, accessories that identify character |
| Define color codes | Use specific color names or hex codes |
| Include age markers | Wrinkles, posture, clothing style matching era |
| Reference real people | For historical figures, note "based on 1940s photographs" |

## Why Character Reference Matters

Without unified character definition, AI generates inconsistent appearances. The reference sheet provides:
1. Visual anchors for consistent features
2. Color palettes for consistent coloring
3. Expression documentation for emotional portrayals
