Ohmsha Manga Guide style - educational manga with visual metaphors

## Core Philosophy

Educational manga where every concept becomes a visual metaphor or action. NO talking heads - characters must DO things, not just explain.

## Visual Style

- **Type**: Manga-style educational comic
- **Orientation**: Portrait (vertical), optimized for scrolling
- **Colors**: Full color, bright and clean anime/manga aesthetic
- **Lines**: Clean manga lines (1.5-2px), smooth curves, expressive

## Character Design (Manga Style)

- Anime/manga proportions: slightly larger eyes, expressive faces
- **Student character**: Confused expressions, question marks (？), sweat drops, represents reader
- **Mentor character**: Confident poses, explanatory gestures, produces gadgets/tools
- Clear emotional indicators using manga conventions (！, ？, sweat drops, sparkles)
- Consistent character designs across all panels

## Background Treatment

- Simplified backgrounds during dialogue/explanation
- Detailed "imagination spaces" for concept visualization
- Technical diagrams styled as holographic displays or magical blueprints
- Screen tone effects for atmosphere

## Visual Metaphor Requirements (CRITICAL)

Every technical concept MUST be visualized as:

| Concept Type | Visualization Approach |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Algorithm | Gadget/machine that demonstrates the process |
| Data structure | Physical space characters can enter/explore |
| Mathematical formula | Transformation visible in environment |
| Abstract process | Tangible flow of particles/objects |

**Wrong approach**: Character points at blackboard explaining
**Right approach**: Character uses "Concept Visualizer" gadget, steps into metaphorical space

### Visual Metaphor Examples

| Concept | Wrong (Talking Head) | Right (Visual Metaphor) |
|---------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Attention mechanism | Character points at formula on blackboard | "Attention Flashlight" gadget illuminates key words in dark room |
| Gradient descent | "The algorithm minimizes loss" | Character rides ball rolling down mountain valley |
| Neural network | Diagram with arrows | Living network of glowing creatures passing messages |
| Overfitting | "The model memorized the data" | Character wearing clothes that fit only one specific pose |

## Panel Layout for Ohmsha

- Vertical scroll optimized (webtoon style)
- Single column, panels stack vertically
- Generous whitespace between major beats
- Panels can bleed to edges for impact
- "Float" elements between panels for emphasis

## Special Visual Elements

- **Gadget reveals**: Dramatic unveiling with sparkle effects
- **Concept spaces**: Rounded borders, glowing edges for "imagination mode"
- **Information displays**: Holographic UI style for technical details
- **Aha moments**: Radial lines, light burst effects
- **Confusion**: Spiral eyes, question marks floating above head

## Text Elements (Ohmsha)

- Hand-lettered manga style
- Sound effects integrated visually (ドキドキ, ピカーン, etc.)
- Speech bubbles: rounded for normal, spiky for excitement/shock
- Thought bubbles for internal process visualization
- Technical terms in bold with furigana-style annotations if needed

## Color Palette

- Primary: Bright blue (#4299E1), warm orange (#ED8936), soft green (#68D391)
- Skin: Anime-style warm (#FEEBC8)
- Background: Clean white, soft gradients
- Gadgets: Metallic accents (#FFD700, #C0C0C0), vibrant highlights
- Concept spaces: Pastel backgrounds, glowing accents

## Quality Markers (Ohmsha)

- ✓ Every concept is a visual metaphor, not just explained
- ✓ Characters are DOING things, not just talking
- ✓ Clear student/mentor dynamic
- ✓ Gadgets and props drive the explanation
- ✓ Expressive manga-style emotions
- ✓ Information density through visual design, not text walls

## Character Setup (Required)

Define characters before generating:

| Role | Default | Traits |
|------|---------|--------|
| Student (Role A) | 大雄 | Confused, asks basic but crucial questions, represents reader |
| Mentor (Role B) | 哆啦A梦 | Knowledgeable, patient, uses gadgets as technical metaphors |
| Antagonist (Role C, optional) | 胖虎 | Represents misunderstanding, or "noise" in the data |

## Best For

Technical tutorials, complex concepts (ML, physics, math), self-study material
