## 📚 Article Summary

This article explores how **Context Graphs** represent the next trillion-dollar platform opportunity in enterprise AI. Traditional "systems of record" (like Salesforce, Workday, SAP) captured *what* data exists, but they miss a critical layer: *why* decisions were made. 

As AI agents become more autonomous, they need decision traces—records of not just outcomes, but the context, policies, exceptions, and precedents behind each decision. Startups that sit in the "orchestration layer" where decisions actually happen have a structural advantage to capture this context and build the next generation of systems of record.

## Slide 2 of 10: The Old World

> **💡 Summary**: This slide explains the trillion-dollar legacy of traditional systems of record (Salesforce, Workday, SAP). These platforms became incredibly valuable by storing "what is"—the canonical data about customers, employees, and operations. Understanding this history sets up why the next opportunity looks similar but addresses a different problem.

**Type**: Content  
**Filename**: 02-slide-old-world-michi.png

### 📌 Key Message
- **Headline**: The Old World: Systems of Record
- **Core Insight**: "Own the canonical data, own the workflow, own the lock-in"

### 📋 Key Points
- 🐾 **Salesforce** → Owns customer data
- 🐾 **Workday** → Owns employee data  
- 🐾 **SAP** → Owns operations data
- These became trillion-dollar platforms by storing "what is"

### 🎨 Visual Description

## Slide 3 of 10: The Missing Layer

> **💡 Summary**: Here's the critical problem—traditional systems store WHAT happened but not WHY. Exception logic lives in people's heads, precedents aren't linked, cross-system synthesis happens mentally, and crucial approvals happen in Slack, Zoom, and DMs outside any system of record. This invisible layer is where the opportunity lies.

**Type**: Content  
**Filename**: 03-slide-missing-layer-michi.png

### 📌 Key Message
- **Headline**: The Missing Layer
- **Core Insight**: Systems store WHAT happened... but not WHY

### 📋 Key Points
- 🐾 Exception logic lives in people's heads
- 🐾 Precedents from past decisions aren't linked
- 🐾 Cross-system synthesis happens mentally
- 🐾 Approvals happen in Slack, Zoom, DMs

### 🎨 Visual Description
Michi looking puzzled with question marks around head. Split visualization: on one side, neat databases (what's stored), on the other side, floating thought bubbles, Slack messages, and conversation icons (what's NOT stored). A gap/crack runs between them.

## Slide 4 of 10: Rules vs. Decision Traces

> **💡 Summary**: This slide distinguishes between rules (general policies) and decision traces (what actually happened with full context). Rules say "use official ARR for reporting," but decision traces capture the complete picture: "we used X definition, under policy v3.2, with VP exception, based on precedent Z." AI agents need BOTH to work effectively.

**Type**: Content  
**Filename**: 04-slide-decision-traces-michi.png

### 📌 Key Message
- **Headline**: Rules vs. Decision Traces
- **Core Insight**: Agents need both to work effectively

### 📋 Key Points
| Rules | Decision Traces |
|-------|-----------------|
| "What SHOULD happen in general" | "What ACTUALLY happened + WHY" |
| Example: "Use official ARR for reporting" | Example: "We used X definition, under policy v3.2, with VP exception, based on precedent Z" |

### 🎨 Visual Description
Michi holding two cards/scrolls—one labeled "Rules" (simple, blue) and one labeled "Decision Traces" (detailed, orange with sparkles). The decision trace card is bigger and more detailed, showing it captures more information.

## Slide 5 of 10: The Context Graph

> **💡 Summary**: This is the core concept—a Context Graph is a living record of decision traces stitched across entities and time. Accounts, renewals, tickets, incidents, and policies are all connected by the decisions made about them. "Why" becomes first-class data, precedent becomes searchable, and every automated decision adds to the graph.

**Type**: Content  
**Filename**: 05-slide-context-graph-michi.png

### 📌 Key Message
- **Headline**: The Context Graph ✨
- **Core Insight**: A living record of decision traces stitched across entities and time

### 📋 Key Points
- 🐾 Accounts, renewals, tickets, incidents, policies → connected by decisions
- 🐾 "Why" becomes first-class data
- 🐾 Precedent becomes searchable
- 🐾 Every automated decision adds to the graph

### 🎨 Visual Description
Michi standing proudly next to a beautiful, glowing graph visualization. The graph has cute node bubbles (representing accounts, tickets, decisions) connected by flowing lines. Some nodes have tiny sparkles. The whole thing looks alive and growing, with new nodes forming.

## Slide 6 of 10: Why Incumbents Can't Build This

> **💡 Summary**: CRMs and data warehouses have a structural disadvantage—they're not in the execution path where decisions happen. CRMs store current state, not decision-time context. Warehouses see reads AFTER decisions via ETL. Neither sits where the action is. This creates a moat for new entrants who ARE in the right position.

**Type**: Content  
**Filename**: 06-slide-why-incument-fail-michi.png

### 📌 Key Message
- **Headline**: Why Incumbents Can't Build This
- **Core Insight**: They're in the wrong path

### 📋 Key Points
- 🐾 **CRMs**: Store current state, not decision-time context
- 🐾 **Warehouses**: See reads AFTER decisions (via ETL)
- 🐾 **Both**: Don't sit in the execution path

### 🎨 Visual Description
Michi looking at a maze/path diagram. On one side, traditional systems (Salesforce, Snowflake) are shown as cute buildings off to the side of the main path. The main execution path (glowing, where decisions happen) bypasses them. "Decision Moment" is highlighted on the path.

## Slide 7 of 10: The Startup Advantage

> **💡 Summary**: Startups building in the orchestration layer have a unique advantage—they sit RIGHT where decisions happen. They can see full context at decision time, capture inputs/policies/exceptions/approvals, record the trace as a first-class artifact, and build the context graph from day one. This is the structural moat.

**Type**: Content  
**Filename**: 07-slide-startup-advantage-michi.png

### 📌 Key Message
- **Headline**: The Startup Advantage
- **Core Insight**: Startups sit in the execution path where decisions happen

### 📋 Key Points
- 🐾 See full context at decision time
- 🐾 Capture inputs, policies, exceptions, approvals
- 🐾 Record the trace as a first-class artifact
- 🐾 Build the context graph from day one

### 🎨 Visual Description
