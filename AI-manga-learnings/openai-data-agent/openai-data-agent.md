# Inside OpenAI’s in-house data agent

## Article Summary

OpenAI has built a bespoke **internal data agent** powered by **GPT-5.2** to help their employees explore and reason over 600PB of data.

**The Problem:**
With 70,000 datasets and massive scale, simply finding the right data table was time-consuming. Analysts spent too much time debugging SQL and filtering logic instead of focusing on metrics and decisions.

**The Solution:**
A "conversational companion" agent that lives where employees work (Slack, IDE, Web). It allows users to ask questions in natural language and get answers in minutes.

**Key Features:**
1.  **Self-Correction**: The agent doesn't just give up on errors; it investigates, adjusts its approach, and retries (closed-loop learning).
2.  **Context Aware**: It uses multiple context layers including table lineage, human annotations, and code definitions to understand the "meaning" of data.
3.  **Trust & Security**: It inherits OpenAI's existing security model and uses Evals to unit-test its own answers against golden sets.

**Impact:**
Teams across Engineering, Finance, and Research use it to answer high-impact questions instantly, democratizing access to data insights.
