# Page 5: Future Directions

Retro technical illustration comic page with 4-panel grid.

## Panel 1 (Top Left - 1/4 page)
**Scene**: Direction 1 - Break PCIe Limits

Visual metaphor of breaking barriers:
- PCIe barrier shown as chain or brick wall
- ScaleUp protocol as powerful lightning bolt shattering the barrier
- Fragments flying outward
- Liberation/breakthrough energy

**Label**: "BEYOND PCIE"
**Subtext**: "Connect peripherals via ScaleUp protocol"

## Panel 2 (Top Right - 1/4 page)
**Scene**: Direction 2 - Native Memory Semantics

Simplified data path visualization:
- GPU chip icon at center
- Direct simple arrow to memory pool
- Old complex paths shown faded/crossed out (PCIe, drivers, translation layers)
- Clean, efficient path highlighted

**Label**: "NATIVE GPU MEMORY ACCESS"
**Subtext**: "Simplified operations, high concurrency"

## Panel 3 (Bottom Left - 1/4 page)
**Scene**: Direction 3 - Topology Simplification

Transformation diagram:
**Left side**: 3-layer diagram (ScaleUp + ScaleOut + DCN) - complex
**Arrow** pointing right (transformation)
**Right side**: 2-layer diagram (ScaleUp + High-bandwidth DCN) - simpler

Shows merger and simplification.

**Label**: "SIMPLIFIED ARCHITECTURE"
**Subtext**: "From 3 layers to 2 layers"

## Panel 4 (Bottom Right - 1/4 page)
**Scene**: Direction 4 - Optical Interconnection

Retro-futuristic vision:
- Ethereal light beams replacing copper cables
- Laser-like connections between nodes
- NPO/CPO modules visualized as glowing crystals
- 1960s sci-fi laser aesthetic

**Label**: "LIGHT-SPEED FUTURE"
**Subtext**: "256+ GPU ScaleUp domains"

**Overall Style**:
- Retro technical illustration
- Each panel has vintage label typography
- Aged paper texture throughout
- Teal/orange/copper palette with dramatic accents
