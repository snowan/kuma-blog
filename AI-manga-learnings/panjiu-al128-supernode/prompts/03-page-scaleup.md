# Page 3: ScaleUp Interconnection

Retro technical illustration comic page with 3 panels.

## Panel 1 (Top - 1/3 page)
**Scene**: Single-stage switching topology

Isometric view of ScaleUp architecture:
- 64 GPU nodes as glowing orange cubes arranged in grid
- 8 ALink switch nodes as brass junction boxes in center
- Single-stage mesh connections shown as glowing teal lines
- All GPUs directly connected to switch layer
- No multi-hop needed - direct paths everywhere

**Label**: "14-28 Tbit/s per GPU"
**Style**: Vintage circuit diagram meets modern network topology

## Panel 2 (Middle - 1/3 page)
**Scene**: ALink vs Ethernet comparison

Side-by-side comparison visualization:
**Left side - ALink Protocol**:
- Sleek lightning bolt connections
- Sharp, fast, direct
- Label: "ALink - Native Memory Semantics"

**Right side - Ethernet (Traditional)**:
- Slower wave patterns
- More overhead, complex headers
- Crossed out with red X

**Center**: Speed comparison meter showing ALink advantage
**Big Label**: "ULTRA-LOW LATENCY"

## Panel 3 (Bottom - 1/3 page)
**Scene**: Dr. Lin explains the insight

Dr. Lin gesturing at holographic topology diagram:
- Floating hologram of interconnect topology (retro hologram with scan lines)
- His hand extended, pointing at key connections
- Expression: Teaching, confident

**Speech Bubble**: "Single-stage switching = instant GPU-to-GPU communication. No multi-hop delays."

**Background**: Faded blueprint of supernode architecture

**Overall Style**:
- Retro technical illustration
- Hologram has scan lines and glow effect (vintage sci-fi)
- Aged cream paper texture
- Teal/orange/copper color scheme
