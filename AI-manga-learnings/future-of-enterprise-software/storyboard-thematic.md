## Summary
Aaron Levie argues that AI agents won't replace enterprise software but will expand its market by taking over "work" rather than just providing tools. He distinguishes between "deterministic" software (reliable machinery like ERP) and "non-deterministic" agents (operators), predicting a shift from seat-based to consumption-based pricing.

## Page 1: Cover
**Layout**: Full page, title prominent.
**Visual**: A cute calico cat (Michi) wearing a futuristic VR headset or glasses, standing in front of a giant, glowing, complex machine (representing enterprise software). The machine has gears and pipes, but they are digital/holographic.
**Text**: "The Future of Enterprise Software" / "Will AI Eat the World?"

## Page 2: Why We Buy Software
**Section Summary**: Enterprise software is the "codification of process" - distinct from what agents do.
**Layout**: Split panel. Top: Michi looking at a messy desk ("Before Software"). Bottom: Michi looking at a neat, organized factory line ("After Software").
**Visual**:
-   Panel A: Chaos. Papers flying, Michi confused.
-   Panel B: Order. A conveyor belt identifying "Core" vs "Context". Rigid, stable structures.
**Text**: "Software = Stability. It's the parts of business you DON'T want to change spontaneously."

## Page 3: The Factory Analogy
**Section Summary**: Software is the machinery; Agents are the operators.
**Layout**: Large diagrammatic view.
**Visual**: A factory floor. Big, solid machines labeled "ERP", "HR", "Security". They are the "Deterministic" systems. Little robot-cats (Agents) are running around operating them—filling forms, pulling levers, reading reports.
**Text**: "Deterministic Systems (Software) need Reliability. Non-Deterministic Systems (Agents) provide Flexibility."

## Page 4: 100x Agents
**Section Summary**: More agents means MORE value for systems of record, not less.
**Layout**: Dynamic splash.
**Visual**: Michi is surrounded by hundreds of helpful agent-bots. They are all plugged into the central "System of Record" machine. The machine is glowing brighter because it's being used so much.
**Text**: "In a world of 100x Agents, the System of Record becomes MORE valuable."

## Page 5: The Unconstrained Market
**Section Summary**: Software markets will grow because they tap into labor budgets, not just IT budgets.
**Layout**: Comparison Chart style.
**Visual**:
-   Left: A small pie chart labeled "IT Budget (3-7%)". Michi holding a small slice of cake.
-   Right: A HUGE pie chart labeled "Total Labor Spend". Michi holding a massive tiered cake.
**Text**: "Agents bring the 'Work' with them. The market isn't just software anymore... it's the whole job."

## Page 6: The New Business Model
**Section Summary**: Shift from Per-Seat to Consumption.
**Layout**: 2-panel comparison.
**Visual**:
-   Panel A (Old): "Per Seat". Empty chairs with price tags.
-   Panel B (New): "Consumption". A meter spinning rapidly as agents work. Coins flowing in.
**Text**: "Seats don't make sense for billion-agent armies. The future is Usage-Based."

## Page 7: Conclusion
**Section Summary**: A dynamic and exciting period ahead.
**Layout**: Hero shot.
**Visual**: Michi looking at a horizon where digital cities are being built by agents and software together. Hopeful, exciting vibe.
**Text**: "The most dynamic period in software history starts now."
