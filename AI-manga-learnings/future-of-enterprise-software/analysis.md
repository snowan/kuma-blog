## Target Audience
- Tech professionals, enterprise leaders, investors, and software developers interested in the impact of AI agents.

## Value Proposition
- Clarifies the role of traditional software vs. AI agents.
- Explains "deterministic vs. non-deterministic" systems.
- Predicts massive market expansion ("unconstrained software markets").

## Core Themes
1.  **Core vs. Context**: Why buy software? (Stability, standardization).
2.  **Machinery vs. Operators**: Software is the machine; Agent is the operator.
3.  **Market Expansion**: Budgets shifting from IT spend (3-7%) to Labor spend (Total Work).

## Key Figures
- **The Factory Owner (Narrator)**: Explains the concepts.
- **The Machine (ERP/Software)**: Rigid, reliable, deterministic.
- **The Agent (AI)**: Flexible, creative, non-deterministic.

## Content Signals
- "Future of software" -> Tech / Blueprint
- "Machinery vs People" -> Metaphorical / Manga
- "Business models" -> Educational

## Recommended Approaches
1.  **Thematic (Recommended)**: Focus on the 3 main arguments (Why we buy, Deterministic vs Non-deterministic, Market Size). Perfect for an educational "manga guide".
2.  **Chronological/Evolution**: History of software -> Present (SaaS) -> Future (Agents).
3.  **Character/Story**: A specific CEO deciding how to buy software in the age of agents.
