# The future of enterprise software

**Introduction**
One of the biggest topics right now in the tech world is what does the future of software look like when AI agents are doing a substantial amount of work in the enterprise. Does software get compressed and simply become a database that agents leverage? Do we use AI agents to code all our own personalized enterprise software in the future? Do startups or incumbents win this new battle? How big are software markets in a world of agents using these tools? And much much more. It’s impossible to try and tackle all of these questions sufficiently in one sitting, but I figured I’d lay out a bit of a roadmap for what enterprise software looks like in the future.

**Why companies buy software**
Firstly, we should all get on the same page about why companies use and buy enterprise software in the first place. You can think of enterprise software as a codification of a company’s processes. These are the parts of your company that you don’t want to change spontaneously, because they provide the structure for your workflows and operations to keep your business running, or allow you to do the other work that really matters.

A large car company decides to procure an ERP system because it’s the backbone for complex global operations where failures could mean far more than the cost of the system. It’s responsible for keeping track of tens or hundreds of billions in revenue, and the company wants to ensure that every single transaction that they make goes through the exact same way every single time, with five 9s of uptime and reliability, and with an output that they can get accepted and approved by the auditors.

The reason companies choose specialized vendors can be understood by "core" vs. "context." Core makes your company unique; context is necessary but largely non-differentiating (payroll, IT tickets, ERP). Software helps define these underlying workflows so companies don't have to reinvent the wheel.

**Deterministic vs. non-deterministic systems**
If you take the analogy of the industrial world, software is like the machinery in a manufacturing plant; and agents are like the people that operate that machinery. In deterministic software, you want things to happen the same way every time (ERP calculations, security permissions, HR reporting structures). Conversely, you want non-deterministic systems (AI agents) for things people have always done: filling out notes, generating sales presentations, answering support inquiries, or doing research.

In a world of 100X more AI agents than people, the value of systems of record will go up, not down. Software provides the guardrails on which agents operate and gives them the tools to be more productive. As long as humans and agents interact, deterministic software will be needed to bridge these interactions seamlessly.

**Unconstrained software markets**
Traditionally, software budgets were constrained to 3-7% of revenue. With AI agents, the software brings the "work" with it, meaning players are going after the total spend that goes into doing that work, not just the tech. For example, the legal services market is ~$400B, far larger than current legal software. AI agents could capture multiple percentage points of that spend, multiplying the software market size overnight.

**The opportunity ahead for software**
Some incumbents will lose if they can't adapt their business models or tech stacks fast enough (e.g., in customer support or coding). New categories of agent-native software will be created. Moats will belong to those with high data volume, complex workflows, and strong human-in-the-loop elements.

**Business Model Evolution**
Systems will evolve from per-seat models to consumption and usage-based models. Since one agent could do a billion things or a billion agents could do one thing, "seats" no longer make sense for agents. We will likely see a mix where people remain as "seats" and agents are monetized through consumption.

**Conclusion**
There is still plenty to play out, but this will certainly be the most dynamic and exciting period in software history.
