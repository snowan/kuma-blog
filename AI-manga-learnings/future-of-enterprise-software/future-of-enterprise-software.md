## Summary

In this analysis of the "The Future of Enterprise Software", Aaron Levie argues that the rise of AI agents will not replace traditional enterprise software but rather expand its market and importance. He distinguishes between "deterministic" software (the machinery) and "non-deterministic" agents (the operators), positing that reliable, structural systems of record are essential guardrails for agentic work. Levie predicts a massive market expansion as software moves from capturing IT budgets (3-7% of revenue) to capturing total labor spend, driving a business model evolution from per-seat pricing to consumption-based economics.

## 1. CEO Michi's Dilemma

One of the biggest topics in the tech world today is the future of software in an age of AI agents. Will software "compress" into a simple database that agents leverage? Will we use agents to code our own personalized tools? Or is there a different path entirely?

CEO Michi represents every leader facing this dilemma. The uncertainty is real: Do startups or incumbents win? How big are these markets? It’s impossible to answer everything, but we can lay out a roadmap.

## 2. The Budget Meeting

For decades, enterprise software budgets have been constrained to roughly **3-7% of revenue** (the standard IT spend). This was the ceiling.

However, Levie points out a massive shift: **With AI agents, the software brings the "work" with it.** This means players aren't just competing for tech budgets anymore—they are going after the **total labor spend** that goes into doing that work.

Michi realizes the scale of the opportunity: Why just pay $1M for a tool when the labor to *use* that tool costs $100M? If agents can capture even a fraction of that labor market (e.g., the $400B legal services market vs. the small legal software market), the potential revenue multiplies overnight.

## 3. The Bad Idea

Michi tries the radical approach: "Fire the software! Let Agents do it all!" This highlights a critical distinction Levie makes between **Deterministic** and **Non-Deterministic** systems.

*   **Deterministic (Software)**: You want things to happen the exact same way every time (ERP calculations, security permissions, HR reporting).
*   **Non-Deterministic (Agents)**: You want flexibility for creative or variable tasks (generating notes, research, answering support queries).

Relying solely on non-deterministic agents for core business processes leads to chaos. Without the rigid rules of software, you get inconsistency and operational failure.

## 4. The Realization

A wise consultant (Levi-san) appears to explain why companies buy software in the first place: **to codify process**.

Enterprise software defines the structure for workflows and operations that keep a business running. It handles the "Core" (what makes a company unique) and the "Context" (necessary but non-differentiating tasks like payroll).

A large car company, for instance, buys an ERP system because it needs five 9s of reliability for billions in revenue. They *don't* want that to change spontaneously. You need this backbone to ensure every transaction is accepted and approved by auditors.

## 5. The Harmony

The solution isn't Software *OR* Agents, but Software *AND* Agents.

Levie uses an industrial analogy: **Software is like the machinery in a manufacturing plant; Agents are like the people that operate that machinery.**

In a world of 100X more AI agents, the value of these systems of record actually **goes up**, not down. Software provides the guardrails on which agents operate. It gives them the tools to be productive. As long as humans and agents interact, we need deterministic software to bridge those interactions seamlessly.

## 6. The Payoff

This shift fundamentally changes the business model of software.

Pricing models will evolve from **"per-seat"** to **consumption and usage-based** models.
*   "Seats" don't make sense when one agent could do a billion things, or a billion agents could do one thing.
*   We will likely see a mix: humans remain as "seats", while agents are monetized through consumption.

By tapping into the "unconstrained market" of total labor spend, the economic potential for software companies explodes.

## 7. Conclusion

We are entering the most dynamic period in software history.

The winners will be those—whether startups or incumbents—who can build the complex workflows and data volume that allow humans and agents to collaborate effectively. The future isn't about replacing software with agents; it's about building the **hybrid enterprise** where software provides the rails, and agents provide the speed.
