**PAGE TITLE**: "Uncovering the Trio"

**PANEL 1 (Top, dramatic - 30% height)**:
Dramatic reveal scene. Three bug creatures emerging from the shadows of server infrastructure. Engineers' silhouettes in foreground looking up at the bugs. Light beams illuminating each bug. Text box: "Investigation revealed not one, but THREE overlapping bugs."

**PANEL 2 (Bottom left, tall - 70% height, 33% width)**:
**BUG #1 - ROUTY (Router Bug)**
Full character reveal of Routy: Round blue body (#6B8E9F), arrow-shaped tentacles pointing in wrong directions, confused spiral eyes, surrounded by tangled routing lines and question marks. The bug looks accidentally harmful, not malicious.
Label: "BUG 1: Context Window Routing Error"
Caption: "Short requests sent to 1M token servers. Initially 0.8%, peaked at 16%."

**PANEL 3 (Bottom center, tall - 70% height, 34% width)**:
**BUG #2 - GLITCHY (Corruption Bug)**
Full character reveal of Glitchy: Purple/magenta pixelated form (#9B59B6), one eye larger than the other, shape unstable and flickering. Foreign characters floating around it: "สวัสดี", "中文", random symbols. Scrambled text bubbles nearby.
Label: "BUG 2: Output Corruption"
Caption: "Token errors. Wrong characters appearing mid-response."

**PANEL 4 (Bottom right, tall - 70% height, 33% width)**:
**BUG #3 - DECIMAL (Precision Bug)**
Full character reveal of Decimal: Two misaligned gears labeled "bf16" and "fp32", calculator-like digital display as eyes, mechanical gray (#95A5A6) with red error indicators (#E74C3C). Probability numbers and decimal points floating around.
Label: "BUG 3: XLA:TPU Miscompilation"
Caption: "Precision mismatch in top-k sampling. The most elusive."

**Color Palette**:
- Background: Slightly darker cream for dramatic effect
- Bug 1: Cool blue #6B8E9F
- Bug 2: Purple #9B59B6
- Bug 3: Gray #95A5A6 with red #E74C3C

**Style**: Ligne-claire, each bug has distinct personality, not scary but troublesome, character design emphasis
