Create a manga page in ligne-claire style with warm tones. 4-panel layout for the final commitment page.

**PAGE TITLE**: "Moving Forward"

**PANEL 1 (Top, dramatic - 35% height)**:
Powerful visual: Claude (anthropomorphized as gentle orange-glowing figure) in the center, surrounded protectively by the engineering team (Sarah, Marcus, Priya, and other team silhouettes). They form a supportive circle around Claude. Claude looks healthy and bright. Warm golden light radiating outward. Text box in bold: "To state it plainly: We never reduce model quality due to demand, time of day, or server load."

**PANEL 2 (Middle - 25% height)**:
Wide panoramic view of the infrastructure running smoothly. All three hardware platforms (TPU, GPU, Trainium) working in harmony, connected by clean data streams. The space where bugs once hid is now bright and clear. Users visible in background, all happy. Text box: "The problems our users reported were due to infrastructure bugs alone."

**PANEL 3 (Bottom left - 40% height, 50% width)**:
Close-up of a user's hand clicking the thumbs down feedback button on Claude interface. Alternatively, terminal showing "/bug" command being typed. Arrows flowing from feedback to engineering. Text box: "Use /bug in Claude Code or thumbs down in Claude apps to report issues."

**PANEL 4 (Bottom right - 40% height, 50% width)**:
Final scene: Beautiful sunrise over stylized cloud infrastructure. Warm oranges and golden yellows painting the sky. Silhouette of the team looking toward the horizon hopefully. New day energy. Text box: "We maintain an extremely high bar for quality. We'll keep climbing higher."
