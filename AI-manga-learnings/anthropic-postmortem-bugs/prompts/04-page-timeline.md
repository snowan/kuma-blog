**PAGE TITLE**: "A Perfect Storm"

**PANEL 1 (Top - 25% height)**:
Calendar/timeline visualization. Clean infographic style. August 2025 calendar with key dates highlighted. Ominous cloud formation building over the calendar. Text box: "The bugs overlapped, creating a perfect storm of confusion."

**PANEL 2 (Middle, wide infographic - 35% height)**:
Visual timeline flowing left to right:
- **Aug 5**: Small blue wave (Bug 1), label "Router bug introduced (0.8% impact)"

Each bug creature riding their respective waves, growing larger as they merge.

**PANEL 3 (Bottom left - 40% height, 50% width)**:
Split scene showing contrasting user experiences. Left half: Happy user with green checkmark, Claude working fine. Right half: Frustrated user with red X, Claude giving strange responses. Text box: "Some users saw normal performance while others experienced severe degradation."

**PANEL 4 (Bottom right - 40% height, 50% width)**:
The engineering team (Sarah, Marcus, Priya) huddled around a whiteboard covered with contradictory data. Maps with confusing arrows, charts going in different directions. Marcus scratches his head, Priya looks at notes puzzled. Sarah's speech bubble: "The reports don't match. It's like we're chasing ghosts..."

**Color Palette**:
