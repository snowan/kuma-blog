Subject: Limitations of Current Memory Solutions
Visual: A clunky robot trying to sort books into two rigid boxes marked "Short Term" and "Long Term". The robot looks stiff and is using a ruler (heuristics), struggling to fit a strangely shaped book. Michi watches skeptically from the side.
Background: Industrial, rigid factory setting.
Colors: Steel grey, dull blue, cream (for Michi).
Notes: Contrast the rigid robot with the organic/fluid problem.
