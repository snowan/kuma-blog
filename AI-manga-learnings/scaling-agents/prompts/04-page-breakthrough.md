PLANNER robot on elevated platform:
- Standing on a raised wooden platform/stage, center of composition
- Distinguished boxy robot with chalk white body
- Chalk blue (#66B3FF) accent highlights glowing
- Small glasses catching light
- Antenna held HIGH like a conductor's baton, dramatic pose

Below the platform, organized rows of WORKERS:

- Work helmets, ready/attentive postures
- All looking UP at PLANNER with respect
- Organized, no chaos - clear hierarchy visible
