## Image Prompt

Chalkboard style illustration, dark blackboard background (#1A1A1A), hand-drawn chalk aesthetic with visible texture and dust effects. Educational warm nostalgic classroom feel.

**TITLE**: "THE AGENT ORCHESTRA" in large chalk handwriting at top center, imperfect baseline, visible chalk texture on letters. Subtitle "Scaling Autonomous Coding" below in smaller elegant chalk script.

**CENTRAL COMPOSITION**: A distinguished robot conductor (PLANNER) standing on an elevated wooden platform in the center. PLANNER has:
- Boxy torso with rounded edges, chalk white body
- Chalk blue (#66B3FF) accent highlights on chest, joints
- Small glasses, antenna on top acting like a conductor's baton held high
- Clipboard tucked under other arm
- Confident, commanding pose looking down at orchestra

Below the platform, an organized orchestra of 8-10 smaller sturdy robots (WORKERS) arranged in curved rows like a real orchestra:
- Each WORKER has compact sturdy build, chalk white bodies
- Chalk orange (#FFB366) accent highlights
- Work helmets with small lamps
- Each at their own workstation with code blocks as instruments
- Attentive, focused expressions looking up at conductor

- Soft clouds drawn in chalk white near the top

- Optional: wooden chalk rail frame at bottom edge

**TEXT ELEMENTS**:
