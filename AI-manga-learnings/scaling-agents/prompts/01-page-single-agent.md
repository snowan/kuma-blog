## Image Prompt

Chalkboard comic page illustration, dark blackboard background (#1A1A1A), hand-drawn sketchy chalk lines with visible texture. Educational comic page layout.

**PAGE TITLE**: "Chapter 1: The Limits of a Single Agent" in chalk handwriting at the top, underlined with wavy chalk line.

**MAIN SPLASH (fills most of page)**: 
Center of the composition - a frazzled robot (SOLO) in overwhelming distress:
- Chalk white robot body with pink (#FF9999) warning accent highlights
- Multiple arms (4-6) desperately reaching in all directions simultaneously
- Spiral stressed cartoon eyes showing panic
- Smoke wisps rising from the top of head/vents
- Visible crack lines on the body showing strain
- Sweat drops (shown as small chalk marks) flying off
- Hunched, overwhelmed posture

Surrounding SOLO, an enormous mountain of work:
- Towering stacks of rectangular code blocks/files on all sides
- Papers and task cards flying and piling up
- The stacks lean inward creating a canyon effect
- Some blocks labeled with tiny text ("TODO", "BUG", "FEATURE")

**ATMOSPHERIC ELEMENTS**:
- Error symbols (!) floating around in chalk pink
- Text "TOO MANY TASKS!" written in frantic chalk near the robot
- Text "HELP!" in a small speech bubble or floating
- Spotlight effect focusing on SOLO with dramatic chalk shadows
- Slightly chaotic dust and chalk particles

**TOP-LEFT CORNER INSET (small rounded rectangle, ~1/6 page)**:
"Flashback" style panel showing SOLO in a calm, confident state:
- Same robot but relaxed, happy expression
- Holding just ONE small code block easily
- Clean minimal environment
- Green checkmark ✓ floating nearby
- Caption at top: "For simple tasks..."
- Brighter, calmer chalk tones

**BOTTOM-RIGHT CORNER INSET (small rounded rectangle, ~1/6 page)**:
Thought bubble / question panel:
- Large question marks (???) 
- Text "How do we SCALE?" in chalk
- Abstract thinking vibes
- Transition to next chapter feel

**TEXT ELEMENTS**:
- Narrator box (rectangular chalk border) at top: "Today's agents work well for focused tasks..."
- Panel borders drawn in sketchy chalk
- Clear visual hierarchy between main splash and insets

**VISUAL STORYTELLING**:
The page should communicate:
1. Single agents CAN do simple tasks (flashback inset)
2. But they get overwhelmed by complex projects (main splash)
3. This leads to the question of how to scale (thought inset)

**STYLE NOTES**:
- Imperfect hand-drawn chalk lines throughout
- Visible chalk texture on all elements
- Chalk dust effects especially around the chaos
- Dark chalkboard with subtle scratches
- Comic panel borders in sketchy chalk style
- Portrait 3:4 aspect ratio
