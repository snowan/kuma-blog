## Image Prompt

Chalkboard comic page illustration, 3-panel vertical stack layout, dark blackboard background (#1A1A1A), hand-drawn sketchy chalk lines.

**PAGE LAYOUT**: Three horizontal panels stacked vertically, each taking approximately 1/3 of the page.

---

**PANEL 1 (TOP)** - "Everyone Avoids the Hard Task":
Wide shot of multiple WORKER robots standing in a loose circle, all pointing AWAY from a central threatening object:

Central scary "HARD TASK" block:
- Large rectangular block with spikes/thorns around it
- Ominous chalk red/pink (#FF9999) glow aura
- Text label "HARD TASK" or skull symbol making it look scary
- Dark shadows beneath it

WORKER robots around it (5-6 visible):
- All stepping backward, pointing at someone else
- Nervous expressions: wide eyes, sweat drops
- Body language of avoidance - arms up defensively
- Orange accents but slightly muted/pale showing fear

Text elements:
- Narrator box at top: "With no hierarchy, agents became risk-averse"
- Multiple speech bubbles: "Not my job!", "You do it!", "Too risky!"
- Arrows showing each pointing to another

---

**PANEL 2 (MIDDLE)** - "Only Small Safe Changes":
Montage-style panel showing workers doing trivial, meaningless tasks:

Left section:
- One WORKER carefully polishing a tiny code block with a cloth
- Very small block, almost insignificant

Center section:
- One WORKER moving a single small file from one stack to another
- Minimal effort, minimal impact

Right section:
- One WORKER fixing a tiny comma or period on a document
- Magnifying glass showing the tiny fix

Time passing indicators floating across the panel:
- "Day 1..." → "Day 5..." → "Day 10..." in fading chalk
- Shows passage of time with no real progress

Text elements:
- Narrator box: "They made small, safe changes instead"
- Small speech bubbles: "Fixed a typo!", "Moved a file!"
- Muted, less vibrant chalk colors showing lack of progress

---

**PANEL 3 (BOTTOM)** - "Hard Problems Remain":
Dramatic low-angle shot of the HARD TASK blocks, now even MORE imposing:

The neglected hard tasks:
- Same HARD TASK blocks from Panel 1, but now BIGGER
- Covered in cobwebs drawn in chalk
- Dust clouds gathering around the base
- Small tumbleweed rolling past
- Even more spikes/thorns have grown

Environment:
- Dark, ominous atmosphere
- Abandoned feeling - no workers visible
- Maybe distant worker silhouettes in the far background, ignoring the tasks
- Shadows stretching toward viewer

Text elements:
- Narrator box: "No agent took responsibility for hard problems or end-to-end implementation"
- Large floating text: "STILL WAITING..." with dust cloud effects
- Single lonely thought bubble floating: "Someone else will do it..."
- Chalk gray muted tones dominating

---

**VISUAL STORYTELLING**:
The page communicates the progression:
1. Workers actively avoid hard tasks (blame shifting)
2. Time passes with only trivial work happening
3. The hard problems are still there, getting worse

**STYLE NOTES**:
- Vertical panels emphasize the downward spiral of avoidance
- Progressively more muted/gray tones from top to bottom
- Hard task should look increasingly ominous/scary
- Workers shown as cowardly/evasive (comedy element)
- Chalk texture consistent, dust effects heavy in panel 3
- Portrait 3:4 aspect ratio
