**Visual Prompt**:
Chalkboard style illustration, dark blackboard background (#1A1A1A), hand-drawn chalk aesthetic with visible texture and dust effects. Title "THE AGENT ORCHESTRA" in large chalk handwriting at top, subtitle "Scaling Autonomous Coding" below in smaller text. 

Central composition: A distinguished robot conductor (PLANNER) with chalk blue (#66B3FF) accents standing on an elevated platform, holding baton-antenna, clipboard in other hand. Below, an organized orchestra of smaller sturdy robots (WORKERS) with chalk orange (#FFB366) accents, each at their station with code blocks. In the background, a massive CODE MOUNTAIN made of stacked file rectangles reaches toward the top, with a flag at the summit.

Musical notation and code symbols (`{ }`, `< >`) float around like notes. Stars and sparkles accent the scene. Small chalk dust particles scattered throughout. Warm educational feeling, hand-drawn imperfect lines, authentic chalk texture. Portrait orientation 3:4 aspect ratio.
