# Storyboard: Secure Codebase Indexing

## P1: The Mountain of Code
- **Panel 1**: Dev leads a new team, looking up at a massive, towering mountain made of binary code and files. It looks intimidating. "So much code... indexing this will take forever."
- **Panel 2**: Dr. Index pops out from behind a monitor, grinning. "Not with Cursor! We do things differently here."
- **Panel 3**: Close up on Dr. Index holding a glowing seed. "Let me introduce you to the **Merkle Tree**."

## P2: The Efficient Tree
- **Panel 1**: Dr. Index plants the seed. A beautiful, glowing digital tree grows instantly, representing the file structure.
- **Panel 2**: Dr. Index points to the leaves. "Every file is a leaf. Every branch a folder. All hashed."
- **Panel 3**: Dev changes one small file. Only that single leaf changes color (Red -> Green). The rest of the tree stays still.
- **Panel 4**: "We only sync what changes. No need to rebuild the whole forest for one branch."

## P3: The Newcomer's Shortcut (Simhash)
- **Panel 1**: Dev asks, "But I'm new here. I have NOTHING referenced yet. Do I have to download the whole tree?"
- **Panel 2**: Dr. Index shakes their head. "Nope! We use **Simhash**."
- **Panel 3**: Visual: The system scanning for "Fingerprints". It finds a matching fingerprint from a teammate's computer nearby.
- **Panel 4**: "We find an existing index that resonates with yours. Reuse, don't rebuild."

## P4: Proving Access (Security)
- **Panel 1**: Dev looks worried. "Wait, isn't that dangerous? What if I get code I'm not supposed to see?"
- **Panel 2**: Dr. Index holds up a golden key (Hash). "Content Proofs! You only get the index if you can PROVE you have the files."
- **Panel 3**: Visual: A lock on the shared index. Dev's client presents the 'key' (Merkle Hash). It clicks open.
- **Panel 4**: "No key? No data. Leak proof."

## P5: Instant Fast
- **Panel 1**: The background sync happens silently. The two trees align perfectly.
- **Panel 2**: Dev types a query. BAM! Instant results.
- **Panel 3**: Side-by-side comparison: "Old Way: Hours" (Snail) vs "New Way: Seconds" (Rocket).
- **Panel 4**: Dev and Dr. Index high-five. "Secure. Fast. Done."
