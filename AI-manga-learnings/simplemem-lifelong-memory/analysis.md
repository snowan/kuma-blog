# Comic Analysis: SimpleMem

## Core Theme
**"The Art of Taming Infinite Memories"**
Visualizing the challenge of LLM agents dealing with endless context and the elegant solution provided by SimpleMem's three-stage pipeline.

## Characters
1.  **Ami (The Agent)**: A determined but overwhelmed chib-style robot girl. She tries to remember everything but gets buried under piles of "Data Scrolls".
    - *Visuals*: Shiny white armor, expressive LED eyes, carrying a huge backpack overflowing with papers.
2.  **Memi (The SimpleMem Spirit)**: A small, floating, magical holographic creature (pixie-like).
    - *Visuals*: Glowing blue, geometric wings, holding a magical "Compressor Wand".

## Narrative Arc (Problem-Solution)
1.  **The Burden**: Ami is trying to solve a quest but is weighed down by the history of every step she's taken. She's slow and confused (High Cost, Low Efficiency).
2.  **The Introduction**: Memi appears and offers a better way. "Don't carry everything! Distill it!"
3.  **Stage 1: Compression**: Memi zaps the pile of scrolls. They shrink into neat, glowing "cards" (Semantic Structured Compression).
4.  **Stage 2: Consolidation**: While Ami takes a break, Memi merges similar cards into a single, thicker golden card (Recursive Memory Consolidation).
5.  **Stage 3: Retrieval**: Ami interacts with a villager. Instead of digging through a backpack, a single card floats into her hand instantly (Adaptive Retrieval).
6.  **Victory**: Ami dances happily, light on her feet. A chart shows "30x Faster!" in the background.

## Visual Style Notes

- **Metaphors**: 
    - Context/Tokens = Heavy physical scrolls/books.
