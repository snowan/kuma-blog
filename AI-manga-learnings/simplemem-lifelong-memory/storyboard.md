## Page 0: Cover

## Page 1: The Heavy Past

**Theme**: Context Overload

**Narrative**: 
Michi is an LLM agent who wants to help people. But every time she learns something, she has to carry it forever.
"Passive context extension" means carrying every single book you've ever read.

**Visual**: Michi is staggering under a comical, skyscraper-high stack of books and scrolls labeled "History". She looks exhausted and dizzy. Memi looks concerned nearby.

## Page 2: Magic Trick #1 - Compression

**Theme**: Semantic Structured Compression

**Narrative**: 
Memi teaches Michi the first secret: **Compression**.
"We don't need all the words, just the meaning!"
They use 'entropy-aware filtering' to discard the fluff.

**Visual**: Memi uses a magic wand to zap the huge pile of books. They shrink down into neat, thin, glowing playing cards. The pile is gone, replaced by a tidy deck.

## Page 3: Magic Trick #2 - Consolidation

**Theme**: Recursive Memory Consolidation

**Narrative**: 
"But wait, there's more!" says Memi.
While Michi rests, Memi organizes the cards. Similar memories are merged into stronger, clearer ones.
This is **Recursive Consolidation**.

**Visual**: Michi is sleeping peacefully in a hammock. In the air above her, Memi is merging several small blue cards into a single, radiant golden card.

## Page 4: Magic Trick #3 - Retrieval

**Theme**: Adaptive Query-Aware Retrieval

**Narrative**: 
When a user asks a question, Michi doesn't need to search the whole library.
Memi hands her *exactly* the card she needs.
"Adaptive Retrieval means perfect focus!"

**Visual**: A question mark appears in the air. Memi instantly plucks a single golden card from the deck and hands it to Michi, who looks ready and confident.

## Page 5: The Result

**Theme**: Efficiency & Accuracy

**Narrative**: 
With SimpleMem, Michi is lighter, faster, and smarter.
**Stats**: 26% Better Accuracy, 30x Less Token Cost!

**Visual**: Michi zooming forward like a superhero (motion lines), holding the golden card. Background shows a chart with an arrow going up (Accuracy) and a coin bag shrinking (Cost).
