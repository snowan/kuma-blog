# Image Generation Prompt

**Role**: You are a world-class infographic designer specializing in technical visualization.

**Task**: Create a comprehensive "bento-grid" style infographic summarizing the concept "We're All Addicted To Claude Code".

**Layout**: Bento Grid
- A modular grid of rectangular cells with mixed sizes (1x1, 2x1, 1x2, 2x2).
- One large "Hero" cell featuring the main "Bionic Knee" concept.
- Surrounding cells for "CLI vs IDE", "Context Engineering", and "Dumb Zone".
- Clear cell boundaries with consistent spacing.

**Style**: Technical Schematic
- Visuals: Engineering precision, blueprint aesthetic, clean geometry, grid patterns.
- Colors: Deep blue background (#1E3A5F), white lines, amber highlights (#F59E0B), cyan callouts.
- Typography: Technical stencil or clean sans-serif (text in image should be minimal and legible).

**Content to Visualize**:

1.  **Hero Cell (Largest)**: "The Bionic Knee"
    - Show a fast-moving runner with a glowing, high-tech "bionic knee" mechanism.
    - Represents the "Manager to Maker" 5x productivity boost.
    - Label: "THE BIONIC KNEE: 5x FASTER"

2.  **Comparison Cell**: "CLI vs IDE"
    - Usage of a split composition.
    - Left side: "IDE" (messy file icons, static).
    - Right side: "CLI Agent" (clean command stream, fast motion).
    - Label: "CLI BEATS IDE"

3.  **Process Cell**: "Context Engineering"
    - A flow diagram showing one main node spawning multiple smaller nodes ("Explore Agents") that branch out and return.
    - Represents the sub-agent architecture.
    - Label: "CONTEXT ENGINEERING"

4.  **Gauge Cell**: "Avoid Dumb Zone"
    - A fuel gauge showing "Context" passing 50% into a red warning zone.
    - Label: "RESET CONTEXT @ 50%"

**Visual Constraints**:
- Aspect Ratio: 16:9 (Landscape)
- High contrast, very sharp lines.
- No photorealism; stick to the vector/blueprint style.
- Text should be stylized as headers; detailed text is not necessary, placeholders or simple blocking is fine if text generation is weak.
