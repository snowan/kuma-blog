## Main Topic
How Claude Code and other CLI-based agents are transforming software development by enabling "context engineering," where agents split and manage context across sub-agents to amplify developer productivity (the "Bionic Knee" effect).

## Learning Objectives
After viewing this infographic, the viewer should understand:
1. Why CLI-based agents (like Claude Code) are outperforming IDE-integrated tools due to cleaner sandboxes and task-level abstraction.
2. How "Context Engineering" works: splitting complex tasks into sub-agents (e.g., Explore) that manage their own context and summarize back.
3. The "Bionic Knee" effect: how senior engineers/managers can run 5x faster by using agents to handle implementation details.

## Target Audience
- **Knowledge Level**: Intermediate to Expert Developers
- **Context**: Developers interested in the latest AI coding tools and productivity patterns.
- **Expectations**: To understand *why* Claude Code is different/better and how to use it effectively.

## Content Type Analysis
- **Data Structure**: Comparative (CLI vs IDE) and Process-oriented (Context Engineering workflow).
- **Key Relationships**: 
    - Manager Mode + Agent = Maker Mode (Bionic Knee).
    - Documentation + Open Source -> LLM Training -> User Recommendation (LLM as SEO).
- **Visual Opportunities**: 
    - **CLI vs IDE**: A split screen comparing "File-level thinking" (IDE) vs "Task-level thinking" (CLI).
    - **Context Engineering**: A diagram showing a main agent spawning "Explore" sub-agents, each traversing files and returning summaries.
    - **Bionic Knee**: A visual metaphor of a runner with a bionic knee moving 5x faster.

## Key Data Points (Verbatim)
- "CLI-based agents (Claude Code, Codex) beat IDE-integrated tools because they offer cleaner sandbox environments"
- "context engineering: how agents split, manage, and summarize context across sub-agents"
- "senior engineers and managers benefit most from these tools—they can now code 5x faster with a 'bionic knee'"
- "clear context aggressively (Calvin does it at ~50% token usage)"
- "LLMs as the New SEO: Good open-source docs and social proof help LLMs recommend your tool"

## Layout × Style Signals
- Content type: Comparison (CLI vs IDE) and Process (Context Engineering) → suggests `binary-comparison` or `structural-breakdown`.
- Tone: Technical yet visionary → suggests `technical-schematic` or `corporate-memphis`.
- Audience: Developers → suggests `technical-schematic` (blueprint style) or `bold-graphic`.
- Complexity: Moderate → suggests balanced layouts.

## Design Instructions (from user input)
- User requested to use "baoyu-infographic skills".
- No specific style preference given in prompt, but "technical-schematic" fits the subject well.

## Recommended Combinations
1. **structural-breakdown + technical-schematic** (Recommended): Ideal for visualizing the "Context Engineering" architecture and the "sub-agent" model. Fits the engineering audience.
2. **binary-comparison + bold-graphic**: Good for the "CLI vs IDE" contrast. High impact coverage of the "why CLI beat IDE" theme.
3. **hierarchical-layers + corporate-memphis**: Could work for the "Future of Work" / "Manager to Maker" transformation, showing levels of leverage.
