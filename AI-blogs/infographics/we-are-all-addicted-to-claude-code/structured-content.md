# We're All Addicted To Claude Code

## Overview
A visual summary of why CLI-based coding agents like Claude Code are transforming software development, featuring the "Bionic Knee" effect and Context Engineering.

## Learning Objectives
The viewer will understand:
1. The shift from IDE-integrated tools to CLI-based agents (and why CLI wins).
2. The concept of "Context Engineering" where agents split and manage tasks.
3. The "Bionic Knee" productivity multiplier for senior engineers.

## Section 1: The "Bionic Knee" Effect

**Key Concept**: Senior engineers and managers gain 5x productivity by using agents as a significantly improved "limb".

**Content**:
- "manager mode... but now the last nine days have been like this incredible unlock"
- "I got a new total knee replacement and actually it's a bionic knee and it allows me to run five times faster."
- "The people with deep system knowledge but limited time are suddenly unleashed."

**Visual Element**:
- Type: Illustration
- Subject: A runner with a futuristic glowing "bionic knee" overtaking others.
- Treatment: Dynamic, high-energy.

**Text Labels**:
- Headline: "The Bionic Knee Effect"
- Subhead: "Manager Mode → Maker Mode"
- Labels: "5x Faster", "Deep System Knowledge Unleashed"

## Section 2: CLI beats IDE

**Key Concept**: CLI agents offer superior sandbox environments compared to IDE integrations.

**Content**:
- "CLI-based agents (Claude Code, Codex) beat IDE-integrated tools"
- "IDEs are all about exploring files... CLI is like a totally different thing"
- "cleaner sandbox environments and more composable integrations"

**Visual Element**:
- Type: Comparison Split
- Left: "IDE" (Cluttered, file-bound, static)
- Right: "CLI Agent" (Clean, task-focused, fast)

**Text Labels**:
- Headline: "Why CLI beats IDE"
- Left Label: "File-Level Anchoring"
- Right Label: "Task-Level Abstraction"

## Section 3: Context Engineering

**Key Concept**: The superpower of agents is splitting and delegating context to sub-agents.

**Content**:
- "Managing context well... split up context well"
- "spawn a bunch of these explore sub agents... running Haiku to traverse the file system"
- "do it in their own context window... summarize it for me"

**Visual Element**:
- Type: Flow Diagram
- Subject: A main "Claude Code" node spawning multiple smaller "Haiku" nodes that scan files and return summaries.
- Treatment: Schematic network.

**Text Labels**:
- Headline: "Context Engineering"
- Subhead: "The Real Superpower"
- Labels: "Main Agent", "Explore Sub-agent (Haiku)", "Context Splitting", "Summarization"

## Section 4: Avoiding the "Dumb Zone"

**Key Concept**: Clearing context aggressively prevents agent degradation.

**Content**:
- "LLM's reaching the dumb zone where after a certain amount of tokens, it just starts degrading"
- "Context poisoning is a real thing"
- "Clear context aggressively (Calvin does it at ~50% token usage)"

**Visual Element**:
- Type: Chart/Gauge
- Subject: A gauge showing "Context Fullness" vs "Intelligence".
- Treatment: Warning zone clearly marked.

**Text Labels**:
- Headline: "Avoid the Dumb Zone"
- Action: "Reset at 50% Token Usage"
- Label: "Context Poisoning"

## Design Instructions

### Style Preferences
- Technical yet engaging.
- Use "Corporate Memphis" or "Technical Schematic" to balance the human and technical elements.
- Clean, readable fonts.

### Layout Preferences
- **Bento Grid**: Organize these 4 sections into a cohesive grid.
- "Bionic Knee" as the hero/central image if possible.
