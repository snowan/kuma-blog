# Pi: The Minimal Agent Architecture

Central concept: **Pi Core** - A coding agent with the shortest system prompt

## 4 Core Tools (Primary Spokes)

1. **Read** - Read files & documentation (book icon)
2. **Write** - Create new files (pencil icon)
3. **Edit** - Modify existing code (scissors icon)
4. **Bash** - Execute shell commands (terminal icon)

## Secondary Elements

- **Extension System** - Agent writes its own extensions, hot reloading capability
- **Tree Sessions** - Branch for fixes, merge back without context pollution

## Key Messages

- "Less is More" - Only 4 tools needed
- "Self-Extending" - Agent builds its own capabilities
- "No Plugin Downloads" - Code-first approach

Text labels (in English):
- Title: "Pi: The Minimal Agent"
- Center Hub: "Pi Core"
- Subtitle: "Only 4 Tools. Infinite Possibilities."
- Spokes: "Read", "Write", "Edit", "Bash"
- Extension area: "Self-Extending Extensions"
- Tree session area: "Tree Sessions"
- Footer: "The future of coding agents"
