- Understand what a skill is and how it works
- Learn the three design principles
- See how Skills and MCP work together
- Know the three skill categories
- Apply five workflow patterns
- Follow the quick start checklist

---

## Section 1: What Is a Skill?
**Key Concept**: A skill is a folder that teaches Claude specific workflows
**Content**: 
- SKILL.md (required) — Instructions with YAML frontmatter
- scripts/ (optional) — Executable code
- references/ (optional) — Documentation loaded as needed
- assets/ (optional) — Templates, fonts, icons
**Visual Element**: Folder icon with files inside, calico cat holding a folder
**Text Labels**: "SKILL.md", "scripts/", "references/", "assets/", "Teach Claude Once, Benefit Forever"

---

## Section 2: Three Design Principles
**Key Concept**: Progressive Disclosure, Composability, Portability
**Content**:
- Progressive Disclosure: YAML → SKILL.md → Linked Files (3 levels)
- Composability: Works alongside other skills
- Portability: Claude.ai • Claude Code • API
**Visual Element**: Three cards with icons, calico cat presenting
**Text Labels**: "Progressive Disclosure", "Composability", "Portability"

---

## Section 3: Skills + MCP
**Key Concept**: Kitchen analogy — MCP = tools, Skills = recipes
**Content**:
- MCP: The Kitchen (tools & ingredients) — connects Claude to services
- Skills: The Recipes (workflows & best practices) — teaches how to use them
- Together: Powerful Automation
**Visual Element**: Kitchen scene with calico cat chef holding recipe book
**Text Labels**: "MCP = Kitchen", "Skills = Recipes", "Together = Automation"

---

## Section 4: Three Skill Categories
**Key Concept**: Document Creation, Workflow Automation, MCP Enhancement
**Content**:
- Document & Asset Creation — consistent, high-quality output
- Workflow Automation — multi-step processes
- MCP Enhancement — workflow guidance on top of MCP
**Visual Element**: Three columns with icons, calico cat pointing
**Text Labels**: "Documents", "Workflows", "MCP+"

## Section 5: Five Workflow Patterns
**Key Concept**: Proven patterns from early adopters
**Content**:
1. Sequential Orchestration — multi-step in order
2. Multi-MCP Coordination — span multiple services
3. Iterative Refinement — improve with iteration
4. Context-Aware Selection — different tools per context
5. Domain-Specific Intelligence — specialized knowledge
**Visual Element**: Numbered list with small icons, calico cat studying
**Text Labels**: "Sequential", "Multi-MCP", "Iterative", "Context-Aware", "Domain-Specific"

---

## Section 6: Quick Start
**Key Concept**: Build your first skill in 15–30 minutes
**Content**:
- Identify 2–3 use cases
- Create SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter
- Write clear description (WHAT + WHEN)
- Test triggering & functionality
- Upload or distribute
**Visual Element**: Checklist with rocket icon, calico cat with thumbs up
**Text Labels**: "Quick Start Checklist", "15-30 min"
