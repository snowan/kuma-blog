# Infographic Analysis: OpenAI Harness Engineering

## Source Content
Based on OpenAI's blog post "Harness engineering: leveraging Codex in an agent-first world".

## Analysis
- **Topic**: Software Engineering methodology shift from writing code to designing "harnesses" for agents.
- **Audience**: Software Engineers, Technical Leaders.
- **Tone**: Professional but accessible, innovative.
- **Visual Style**: Kawaii (Simple cute calico cat in Japanese manga/anime style).
- **Layout**: Bento Grid (Modular, clear separation of concepts).

## Key Concepts to Visualize
1.  **The Shift**: From Manual Code -> Harness Engineering.
2.  **Repo as Truth**: Documentation is the map.
3.  **Agent Legibility**: Code meant for agents to read.
4.  **Mechanical Enforcement**: Guardrails and linters.
5.  **Observability**: Seeing what the agent sees.
